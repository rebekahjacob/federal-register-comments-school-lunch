Studies show it takes young children 10-20 times of trying a new food before they accept it. For low-income families, they do not have discretionary money to expose their children to unfamiliar (but healthier) foods and have them rejected more than a few times. Because of this, vulnerable families stick to familiar foods and do not have the luxury of trying out whole grain options or unsweetened milk. Schools can provide a safe space for youth to try new foods without risking the family budget.

2017,FNS-2017-0021-1309,nan,Other government agency - (non school),"Dear Ms. Naiman: 
The New York City (NYC) Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH) welcomes the opportunity to comment on the interim final rule for the “Child Nutrition Programs: Flexibilities for Milk, Whole Grains, and Sodium Requirements,” the continued availability of these flexibilities and their corresponding impacts. DOHMH commends the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) for its efforts to date to support the health of children by providing nutritious meals in schools. 
Ensuring that healthy foods and beverages are available in schools and other NYC agencies is a priority for NYC. The NYC Food Standards were set by Mayoral Executive Order in 2008, and include specific nutrition standards for foods served to children, including limiting sodium and requiring fruits, vegetables, and low-calorie beverages. The Standards apply to more than 240 million meals and snacks served per year across a variety of settings, including schools, childcare centers, and public hospitals. The NYC Department of Education (DOE) serves approximately 950,000 meals daily and has the largest school food service program in the United States, with about $200 million in annual food purchases. City agency programs have consistently reported compliance with the NYC Food Standards in over 90% of programs. It is crucial that NYC’s large investment in feeding New Yorkers results in providing those in its care with healthy food and encourages manufacturers to support these goals. We hope our experience improving the nutritional quality of food served in NYC programs can inform the proposed interim final rule.   
DOHMH offers comment on two aspects of the USDA’s proposed interim rule. First, we oppose any delay of Sodium Target 2. Reaching Sodium Target 2 as scheduled is achievable without further delay. The NYC DOE has been successful working in partnership with manufacturers and suppliers to reduce the amount of sodium in the foods served in NYC schools. These efforts are critical to protect the health of future generations. The sodium levels in Sodium Target 1 remain high and are inadequate to protect the health of American children. As it stands, a child eating lunch in school can consume more than half of her daily intake of sodium in a single meal. Lowering sodium intake reduces the risk of high blood pressure, heart disease and stroke. One in four adult New Yorkers reported having been told they have high blood pressure by a health care provider in 2016. Racial disparities in cardiovascular disease rates among New Yorkers are especially concerning. Black adults have more than three times the early death rate from stroke compared to Whites and nearly two times the rate compared to Latinos. We urge the USDA to prioritize lowering sodium in school meals to help reduce the risk of high blood pressure and cardiovascular disease among its students later in life. 
Second, the interim final rule allows for additional flexibility in whole grain products served in schools. Recommendations made in the Dietary Guidelines for Americans encourage the consumption of whole grains, which are an essential part of a nutritious diet. Whole grains are a source of fiber, which may help 
to lower the risk of heart disease. We recommend maintaining a whole grain-rich product requirement for the National School Lunch Program and School Breakfast program to ensure that whole grains continue to be primarily used where available. We defer to USDA and school food authorities as to how a requirement for whole grains can best be put into practice. 
 
We ask the USDA to consider the recommendations included in this letter not only for the interim final rule, but also for the final rule. We look forward to further advancing our common goal of improving the healthfulness of all food and beverages offered in schools. 
 
Thank you for your consideration.

 RE: Docket ID FNS-2017-0021 
 Dear Ms. Namian: 
 The healthier school meal rules have been an important step for our nation to remedy nutritional shortfalls in childrens diets and to help address the current high rates of obesity and chronic disease. We want the best nutrition for all children, particularly lowincome children who may lack access to consistent healthy, quality food outside of school.  
 The new USDA nutrition standards for school meals are extraordinarily important for the health and academic success of Americas school children. Thirty million children eat lunch at school every day; more than 21 million of them are low-income children whose families are struggling to make ends meet. Nearly 15 million children (12 million of them low-income) eat school breakfast every day. Research shows that the new standards have a positive impact on the school nutrition environment as well as student food selection and consumption, especially for fruits and vegetables.    
 We are concerned about the proposed changes to the school nutrition standards, and strongly support maintaining the current, evidence-based school meal program standards to assure that all children have access to foods that support their health, wellbeing, and learning, irrespective of the school they attend.  
 School meals should be consistent with the Dietary Guidelines for Americans, including serving whole-grain foods and limiting sodium and saturated fat. This is especially important because most American children do not consume enough fiber and whole grains, and consume too much sodium and fat. The majority of schools are fully and successfully meeting the current nutrition requirements already; this is not a time for rolling back the standards. 
 To ensure that children get the full value from the new healthier school meals, we offer these recommendations to increase the reach of the school nutrition programs:  
 
 ensure that students who are eligible for free and reduced-price school meals are certified by working with states to improve and strengthen direct certification systems, and address any barriers in the school meal application process;   encourage schools to offer free breakfast and lunch to all students through the Community Eligibility Provision, and any other federal provisions that are available to schools; and  promote breakfast in the classroom and other alternative school breakfast models. 
 We encourage USDA to continue its excellent nutrition education (e.g., Team Nutrition), program technical assistance, training, and education initiatives. 
In summary, we are concerned about proposed revisions to the school meal standards. Our nations children need and deserve strong, evidence-based nutrition standards that support their learning, health, and well-being.

2017,FNS-2017-0021-4907,nan,Advocacy,"Regarding the proposed changes in the interim final rule presented in document 82 FR 56703,Docket Number FNS-2017-0021 I would like to:
Oppose the option for Child Nutrition Programs (CNPs) to offer flavored, 1% fat milk as a part of a reimbursable meal.
Children can be encouraged to increase their milk consumption without being offered flavored milk. For example, one study (http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S014929181500956X) found that simply placing emoticons next to healthy food options increased consumption of healthy foods. More specifically, this study found that the use of emoticons increased white milk consumption, decreased chocolate milk consumption, but did not decrease milk consumption overall. Behavioral nudges like these can be used to effectively encourage healthy behaviors, not only for plain over flavored milk but also for healthier over less healthy food options. When compared with plain milk, flavored milk can only increase the amount of added sugar in a childs diet, a practice that the 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans (DGA) recommends avoiding (https://health.gov/dietaryguidelines/2015/resources/2015-2020_Dietary_Guidelines.pdf).
Oppose the option to allow School Food Authorities (SFAs) to use specific alternative grain products due to hardship(s) in procuring, preparing, or serving products that are acceptable to students and compliant with the whole grain-rich requirements.
According to the 2015-2020 DGA, diets that are higher in whole grains have been identified as characteristic of healthy eating patterns. Furthermore, diets that have lower intakes of refined grains have also been identified as characteristic of healthy eating patterns (https://health.gov/dietaryguidelines/2015/resources/2015-2020_Dietary_Guidelines.pdf). The potential hardships that might be associated with procuring, preparing, or serving whole grain-rich foods should be alleviated by the sheer availability of these products. According to the Whole Grains Council, which administers the Whole Grain Stamp seen on many foods, there are least 11,000 food products sold internationally that meet the whole grain requirements for CNP meals, with over 75% of these foods being sold in the U.S. (https://wholegrainscouncil.org/whole-grain-stamp/its-working) With this volume of product availability, there are plenty of options for SFAs to procure, prepare, and serve whole grain foods without having to utilize alternative grain products.
Support the retention of Sodium Target 1 through the end of SY 2018-2019.
However, I believe that SFAs should be encouraged to procure and introduce lower sodium foods in preparation for the implementation of Sodium Target 2. Active encouragement should assist the SFAs to successfully reach the new target rather than potentially failing to meet the target after implementation. Failure to meet the target will result in additional regulatory burden as well as negative impacts on SFA budgets, both of which have negative consequences for child nutrition.
As a food bank that currently vends a very low number of daily meals compared to most SFA's, we are able to adhere to the current guidelines, and still produce meals below the reimbursement rate.
Thank you for your consideration.

2017,FNS-2017-0021-5602,nan,Manufacturer/food industry,"On behalf of Slow Food USA, the national, not-for-profit organization dedicated to a food chain that is good, clean, and fair for all, I respectfully submit comments in response to the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) “Child Nutrition Programs: Flexibilities for Milk, Whole Grains, and Sodium Requirements” interim final rule (IFR) (82 FR 56703).  
 
Slow Food USA believes that everyone, most particularly our children, have a right to enjoy, ample, sustainably and humanely produced food that is good for human and environmental health and for those who produce our food.  For the sake of our school children, we strongly oppose weakening school nutrition standards.  Virtually all schools, 99 percent, participating in the National School Lunch and Breakfast Programs are making significant progress in serving healthier meals to our children - with less sodium, more whole grains, fruits, and vegetables, and no trans-fat - and removing access to sugary drinks and unhealthy snack food.1  The 2012 updates to school nutrition standards reflect sound science, support children’s health, and are consistent with the 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans (DGA)2 and the National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine (formerly, Institute of Medicine) 2009 report School Meals: Building Blocks for Healthy Children.3   
 
The Harvard University T.H. Chan School of Public Health concluded that the update to school nutrition standards is “one of the most important national obesity prevention policy achievements in recent decades.”4  Researchers estimate that these improvements prevent more than 2 million cases of childhood obesity and save up to $792 million in health-care related costs over ten  years.  Improved school nutrition is critical given that one out of three children and adolescents aged 2 to 19 years is overweight or obese5,6 and children consume one-third to one-half of daily calories during the school day.7  Contrary to supporting children’s health, the proposed IFR changes could jeopardize it. 
 
Sodium We oppose the proposed three-year delay of the second school meals sodium reduction targets (Target 2), from School Year 2017/18 to School Year 2021/22, that would lock in unsafe levels of sodium in our children’s diets.  Unfortunately, nine out of ten children consume too much sodium,8 increasing their risk of high blood pressure, heart disease, and stroke.9  Many schools’ food service companies, and others in the industry, are working toward or already providing healthy and appealing meals and food products with less sodium.  USDA should address remaining challenges through training and technical assistance.  Delaying the second phase of sodium reduction puts children’s health at risk.  Further, we are opposed to any delay of the third and final phase of school meals sodium reduction (Target 3), which is to go into effect in School Year 2022/23.   
 
Whole Grains We oppose the continuation of whole-grain waivers.  USDA provides in the IFR that 85 percent of schools have not requested waivers and are providing children with appealing whole-grain options.  If 85 percent of our nation’s schools are serving whole grains to their students, the remaining 15 percent can be encouraged to do the same.10  Eating more whole grains is associated with reduced risk of heart disease, stroke, and diabetes, provides more nutrients, and provides a healthful source of fiber.11  Children, on average, consume too few whole grains and too many refined grains.12   
 
Flavored Milk We oppose allowing flavored low-fat (1 percent) milk in school meals and as a competitive food.  The current standards that allow plain or flavored fat-free milk and plain low-fat milk are based on expert recommendations from the National Academy of Medicine’s 2009 report.13  The recommendations disallowed flavored low-fat milk because it would provide more calories and likely cause the school meals calorie maximum to be exceeded.  The 2015 DGA similarly recommended, “increasing the proportion of dairy intake that is fat-free or low-fat milk” and “reducing the intake of added sugars” such as those in flavored milk.14  Similarly, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation’s Healthier Beverage Guidelines recommend only plain fat-free and low-fat milk for children and adolescents.15   
 
Rather than weakening school nutrition standards, we urge the administration to continue improving school food.

2017,FNS-2017-0021-5864,nan,Other government agency - (non school),"As the agency overseeing administration of the NSLP in the District of Columbia, The Office of
the State Superintendent of Education (OSSE) opposes the interim final rule’s flexibility to
provide operators the option to offer flavored, low-fat (1 percent fat) milk in the Child Nutrition
Programs. This flexibility allows and supports service of milk higher in fat content while
providing no additional nutritional benefit. Foods high in sugar and fat content can lead to
obesity and diet-related diseases. Schools have not shown or indicated any hardship meeting the
milk requirements since they went into effect in July of 2012. Since no hardship has been
shown, we see no reason to serve milk at this higher fat content.
Beginning July 1, 2012 (SY 2012-2013), all fluid milk in all District public schools has been
required to be low-fat (1 percent or less, unflavored) or fat-free (unflavored or flavored). School
Food Authorities (SFAs) in the District of Columbia have been offering these milk options for
six school years, and have diligently worked to change student perception and behavior
surrounding milk consumption. This hard work has been successful, and many SFAs have
chosen to limit fat-free flavored milk offered to students. Allowing flavored, low-fat milk in the
Child Nutrition Programs would roll back the progress schools have made in changing student
perception and behavior.
OSSE takes a neutral position, however, on extending the State agencies’ option to allow
individual school food authorities to include grains that are not whole grain-rich in the weekly
menu offered under the National School Lunch Program (NSLP) and School Breakfast Program
(SBP). Currently, there are no District of Columbia School Food Authorities requesting this
flexibility and no allowances have been given.
Lastly, OSSE is in favor of retaining Sodium Target 1 in the NSLP and SBP to allow School
Food Authorities and food manufacturers time to develop and modify products and recipes to
meet these standards and students’ acceptance.",In favor of original HHFKA

2017,FNS-2017-0021-6157,nan,Advocacy,"Attached please find the comment of the Public Health Advocacy Institute at Northeastern University School of Law opposing the weakening of school nutrition standards established by the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2012.
In addition to evidence-based arguments opposing the proposed ""flexibilities,"" the comment notes our research in collaboration with the Berkeley Media Studies Group from 2016 that examined nutrition and policy proposals in 11 states.  We found that two-thirds of relevant legislative or regulatory documents containing at least one policy argument (n=91) argued in favor of the 2012 guidelines.  More than half of those arguments raised in favor of the guidelines argued that the guidelines will allow food service directors to provide healthier options or that the guidelines will benefit children's health. In every state except Oklahoma and Texas, there were more pro-guidelines arguments than anti-guidelines arguments presented.
This comment was primarily authored by Emily Nink, MS and edited by Mark Gottlieb, JD.
As a legal research center focused on public health law, we (the Public Health Advocacy
Institute) respectfully submit these comments in response to the U.S. Department of
Agriculture’s (USDA) “Child Nutrition Programs: Flexibilities for Milk, Whole Grains, and
Sodium Requirements” interim final rule (IFR) (82 FR 56703).
We oppose weakening school nutrition standards established by the Healthy, HungerFree Kids Act of 2012.
Virtually all schools (99 percent) participating in the National School Lunch and
Breakfast Programs are making great progress toward serving healthier meals for lowincome children with less sodium; more whole grains, fruits, and vegetables; and no
trans-fat; and are removing sugar drinks and unhealthy snack foods.1
The public overwhelmingly (86%) supports healthier school meals,2 and the majority of
state policymakers and school meal administrators favor the nutrition guidelines
established by the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act in 2012. State and local governments
have already taken significant policy steps to implement the mandated guidelines of the
federal law, and have done so successfully. Indeed, in our 2016 analysis of policy
proposals and related legislative documents from 11 selected states, we found that twothirds of relevant documents containing at least one policy argument (n=91) argued in
favor of the new guidelines.3 More than half of the arguments in favor of the guidelines
argued that the guidelines will allow food service directors to provide healthier options
or that the guidelines will benefit children's health. In every state except Oklahoma and
Texas, there were more pro-guidelines arguments than anti-guidelines arguments
presented.
The 2012 updates to school nutrition standards reflect sound science, support children’s
health, and are consistent with the 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans (DGA)4
and the National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine (formerly, Institute of
Medicine) 2009 report School Meals: Building Blocks for Healthy Children.
5 Improved
school nutrition is critical given that one out of three children and adolescents aged 2 to
19 years is overweight or obese6,7 and children consume one-third to one-half of daily
calories during the school day.8 Contrary to supporting schools and children’s health, the
proposed changes in the IFR, by making school food less healthy, are likely to negatively
affect the health of school children and their health risks as adults.9
The three-year delay in the sodium reduction levels would harm children’s health:
We oppose the proposed three-year delay of the sodium reduction targets (Target 2) for
school meals, because the delay would allow meals to needlessly extend exposure of
school children to unsafe levels of sodium. Unfortunately, nine out of ten children
consume too much sodium,10 increasing their risk for hypertension, heart disease, and
stroke.11 Many schools and food service companies are working toward or already
providing healthy and appealing meals and products with less sodium. USDA should
address remaining implementation challenges through training and technical assistance
to schools. Delaying the second phase of sodium reduction puts children’s health at risk
and would result in children consuming an extra 84 to 98 teaspoons of salt (over the
course of the three-year delay).12 Further, and for similar reasons, we are opposed to
any delay of the third and final phase of sodium reduction for school meals (Target 3,
which is supposed to go into effect for School Year 2022-2023).
Continuing the whole-grains waiver is unnecessary and undermines child nutrition:There is no need based on concerns related to children’s health to continue the wholegrain waivers. USDA concedes in the IFR that 85 percent of schools have not even
requested waivers and are providing children with appealing whole-grain options. If all
schools in Alabama, Idaho, and Montana, for example, can serve whole grains to their
students, schools in the rest of the states should be able to as well.13 Whole grains
provide micronutrients and are a healthful source of fiber, and eating more whole grains
is associated with reduced risk of heart disease, stroke, and diabetes.14 Children, on
average, consume too few whole grains and too many refined grains.15
Allowing flavored low-fat milk is inconsistent with dietary advice:
We oppose allowing flavored low-fat (1 percent) milk to be served with school meals or
as a competitive food. Flavored low-fat milk has higher fat content than flavored fat-free
milk, and it is a source of added sugar, unlike plain low-fat milk. The current standards
that allow plain or flavored fat-free milk and plain low-fat milk are based on expert
recommendations from the National Academy of Medicine’s 2009 report.16 The
recommendations disallowed flavored low-fat milk because it would provide more
calories (as compared to flavored fat-free milk) and would likely cause the overall meal
to exceed the calorie maximum. The 2015 DGA similarly recommended “increasing the
proportion of dairy intake that is fat-free or low-fat milk” and “reducing the intake of
added sugars” such as those in flavored milk.17 Similarly, the Robert Wood Johnson
Foundation’s Healthier Beverage Guidelines recommend only plain fat-free and low-fat
milk for children and adolescents.18
Conclusion
We oppose further delay of the sodium reduction targets (both Target 2 and Target 3),
the continuation of the whole-grains waiver, and allowing flavored low-fat milk. Rather
than weakening school nutrition standards, we urge the FNS and USDA to support
efforts to continue the progress to improve school food.",In favor of original HHFKA
2017,FNS-2017-0021-6286,nan,Advocacy,"The National Child and Adult Care Food Program (CACFP) Forum appreciates the opportunity to 
comment on “Child Nutrition Programs: Flexibilities for Milk, Whole Grains, and Sodium Requirements” 
(7 CFR 210, 215, 220, 226). The healthy meals and snacks provided by these programs are especially vital 
for low?income children in schools, child care programs, and after school programs. In FY 2017, the 
Forum board member organizations served more than 110 million meals and snacks through CACFP to 
more than half a million children. 
The National CACFP Forum has concerns about the proposed regulations and strongly supports 
maintaining the current child nutrition program standards to assure that all children have access to 
foods that support their long?term health and wellbeing irrespective of the school or program they 
attend.   
Our comments and recommendations are organized into the following sections and put particular 
emphasis on the impact on CACFP and the young children served by the program: 
I. Background 
II. Whole Grain Requirements 
III. Sodium Requirements 
IV. Milk Requirements 
I. Background 
According to a press release by USDA in October of 2016, more than 99% of schools report meeting the 
new nutrition standards put forth by the Healthy Hunger?Free Kids Act (HHFKA) of 2010.1
 We applaud 
these schools for their hard work and success. This high level of compliance with the new nutrition 
standards demonstrates that additional flexibilities are unnecessary. For the small minority of schools 
who are still experiencing challenges meeting the new nutrition standards, the best solution is to 
provide more training, technical assistance, and resources. Maintaining strong nutrition standards is 
especially important for the low?income children receiving free and reduced?price lunches (more than 
20 million) and breakfast (more than 12 million). 2
 We are concerned that relaxing nutrition standards 
would disproportionately impact the children who rely most heavily on school meals for their daily 
nutrition. 
II. Whole Grain Requirements 
We recommend maintaining the current whole grain?rich requirements. According to the Dietary 
Guidelines for Americans 2015?2020, the average intake of whole grains is far below the minimum 
recommendations for all age groups.7
 Many children may not be receiving whole grain?rich items 
outside of USDA child nutrition programs. Despite reports that child acceptance of the new whole grain?
rich requirements is challenging, a number of studies have shown no significant increase and sometimes 
even a decrease in plate waste of entrees (usually a grain and meat/meat alternate combination) in 
spite of the new whole grain?rich and sodium requirements.3,4 
Additionally, the Forum is concerned about the negative impact of the transition to crediting grains 
using ounce equivalents instead of servings for CACFP. There has not been an opportunity for the public 
to comment on this regulation. This will be a significant operational change for CACFP and requires 
added equipment and an understanding of nutritional requirements that extends past that of a common 
household or small center kitchen. The intent of the CACFP is to ensure that children who are at the 
highest risk for poor nutrition have access to healthy foods. By layering on this level of complexity, the 
Forum is concerned that the compliance risk and confusion will deter providers from serving the right 
amounts of grain or even from participating in the program.  
III. Sodium Requirements 
We recommend continuing to move forward with the sodium target 2 as planned while also taking into 
consideration new evidence on sodium intake in the Dietary Guidelines for Americans 2020?2025, if 
applicable. On average, sodium is far above the tolerable upper intake levels for all age groups including 
school?age children. They are especially high for adolescent boys, nearly twice as much as what is 
recommended.7 According to the Centers for Disease Control, about 90% of children in the US ages 6?18 
eat too much sodium each day. 5
 Under the target 1 requirements, children are allowed to have as much 
as two?thirds of their daily sodium limit in a single meal. Sodium consumption is often even higher at 
dinner time than at lunch.5 We recommend continuing to require sodium targets that align with the 
most up?to?date scientific evidence. 
IV. Milk Requirements 
As highlighted in the proposed regulations, relatively few studies answer the question of whether 
increasing the fat content of flavored milk from fat?free to 1% or vice versa will impact consumption. 
This makes it difficult to conclude that decreasing the fat?content would cause decreased milk 
consumption and equally difficult to know whether allowing 1% flavored milk would increase 
consumption. According to a 2013?2014 survey of School Food Authority Directors, fluid milk 
requirements were among the least challenging to meet, and a majority (75%) noted no observable 
change in milk wasted.6
  
Additionally, average saturated fat consumption in the United States exceeds the recommended less 
than 10% of calories per day with 71% of people, including school?age children, not meeting the 
recommendations.7
 Because milk is consumed so frequently among children, requiring fat?free flavored 
milk is a simple, consistent way to decrease the amount of saturated fat and number of unhealthy 
calories in children’s diets.  
Board members of the Forum who are employed by CACFP sponsoring organizations have not heard 
complaints or concerns from CACFP operators about requiring that flavored milk be fat?free. It seems to 
be generally well?accepted. The Forum does recommend that if there are changes to the fat content of 
flavored milk for children 6 and older that the change be the consistent across child nutrition programs 
to prevent confusion among program operators.  Additionally, we commend USDA for continuing to 
prohibit flavored milk for children 5 and under. Based on the available evidence, we recommend 
continuing to offer fat?free flavored milk to children 6 years and older.  
Conclusion 
In summary, the National CACFP Forum strongly opposes revising the child nutrition program standards. 
We urge USDA to maintain the current nutrition standards as they are to best support the long?term 
health of children in the United States. Thank you for this opportunity to comment on the proposed 
changes, and we appreciate your consideration.",In favor of original HHFKA

It is an incontrovertible fact that poor nutrition undermines a child's ability to learn and impacts a brain development.

University School of Public Health (hereafter referred to as the Center) appreciates the
opportunity to submit comments to the Food and Nutrition Service at the United States
Department of Agriculture (USDA) in response to Docket No. FNS-2017-0021 Child Nutrition
Programs: Flexibilities for Milk, Whole Grains, and Sodium Requirements.
The Center opposes implementing the interim final rule that delays sodium reduction targets for
three years and extends waivers for schools failing to provide whole grain options to students.
The interim final rule is unnecessary and not in the best interest of our nation’s students.
The USDA updated school meal requirements following the implementation of the Healthy,
Hunger-Free Kids Act (HHFKA) of 2012. As a result, students now have healthier food options
at school. Unfortunately, some critical nutrition requirements and standards, including those for
sodium reduction and whole grains, have been delayed or waived, despite the important impact
of sodium reduction and whole grains on the health of our youth and the overwhelming majority
of school districts across the nation that are meeting the standards. The delays and waivers in the
interim final rule will mean fewer students will have access to healthy whole grain options and
more students will consume more than the recommended daily intake of sodium leading to future
health risks.
Therefore, the Center strongly opposes this final interim rule. Our concerns are detailed
below.
Background:
According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA)1
, the typical American diet contains
too much sodium. On average, youth aged 6-18 consume roughly 1,000 mg more of sodium each
day than is recommended by the 2010 Dietary Guidelines for Americans2
. Excess sodium intakes
are especially concerning because children who are exposed to excess amounts of sodium are more likely to have high sodium intakes throughout life3
. Excess sodium consumption
contributes to high blood pressure and in turn high rates of heart disease - the number one killer
of men and women in the United States4
. While heart disease is a chronic disease characteristic
of advanced age, factors that contribute to its development can begin in childhood with poor diet,
highlighting the need to reduce sodium consumption amongst school age children. At the same
time, unhealthy diets have been a major driver of obesity rates tripling for children and
quadrupling for adolescents over the last thirty years5
.
According to the most recent data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey6
,
obesity rates among youth in the United States trend upwards as they age. In 2015-16, the
prevalence of obesity was 13.9% among pre-school aged children (2-5 years), 18.4% among
school-aged children (6-11 years), and 20.6% among adolescents (12-19 years). Further,
numerous studies7 have found that childhood obesity predicts adult obesity, the prevalence of
which reached nearly 40% in the US in 2015-16. These observations emphasize that the policy of
ensuring healthier diets at younger ages is even more important. Diet is a major determinant of
obesity and obesity-related chronic diseases. Because many students receive one or more meals
at school each day through the National School Lunch Program (NSLP) and School Breakfast
Program (SBP), the ability of schools to shape this diet to promote health from an early age is
clear. Rules implemented by the USDA in the past, such as the Nutrition Standards in the
National School Lunch and School Breakfast Programs, have been steps toward improving the
health of current youth, soon-to-be adults, and future generations. However, health
improvements will be stymied by the interim rule Child Nutrition Programs: Flexibilities for
Milk, Whole Grain, and Sodium Requirement that would take effect in July of 2018.
Most School Programs are Already Compliant:
The USDA has stated8 that the decision to implement this interim rule is due to feedback from
school operators who have complained about the difficulty of meeting the increasing nutrition
standards in the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2012. However, in 2015 the Food and
Nutrition Service released data showing that 95% of schools were in compliance with the HHFKA standards, contradicting the reasoning for this interim rule9
. Delaying full
implementation of the standards for whole grains, sodium, and flavored milk is a short-sighted
decision that sacrifices the health of students for the sake of a small minority of non-compliant
schools.
Flavored Milk and Whole Grains:
Because the majority of schools already comply with the HHFKA nutrition standards, the Center
feels strongly that it is important to uphold requirements relating to flavored milk and whole
grains. Whole grains are high in fiber, which contribute to a feeling of fullness, and can therefore
reduce overall calorie consumption (a primary way to combat obesity). Consumption of whole
grains can also reduce blood cholesterol levels as well as the risk of coronary heart disease10. The
original rule improved the quality of food/drink options for students by mandating that flavored
milk be fat-free and that grains be whole-grain rich. The Center sees no reason to waive these
requirements, which the vast majority of school districts are already meeting. We encourage the
USDA to reconsider implementing the interim rule. It is unnecessary and will have negative
health consequences.
Sodium Target:
Of greatest concern to the Center is the unnecessary delay in implementing sodium target 2.
Overconsumption of sodium-rich foods are linked to higher rates of hypertension, heart disease,
and stroke11. Currently, sodium intake for nine in ten school aged children in the United States is
excessive12, and unlikely to change if schools are allowed to continue serving sodium-rich foods.
It is especially alarming that language in the interim rule states that the USDA anticipates
extending this particular flexibility through SY20-21. Allowing three years of continued sodium
target 1 regulatory limits for SFAs is a step in the wrong direction and puts the health of students
at risk.
Concluding Remarks
Providing students with healthier food options is a major step to improving their health and
combating the obesity epidemic. The USDA’s Food and Nutrition Service should continue to
uphold standards that improve nutrition in schools, rather than implementing rules that allow
authorities to perpetuate less healthy menu options. The Center strongly opposes the interim
final rule or any act that has negative implications for nutrition standards in schools. We thank the USDA’s Food and Nutrition Service for the opportunity to comment on this final
interim rule and hope it will take our position into account when making a final decision. Please
do not hesitate to contact me (bdietz@gwu.edu) with any questions or concerns relating to our
comments or the final interim rule. The Center looks forward to continued dialogue and
engagement from the USDA about this final interim rule. ",In favor of original HHFKA

As a teacher, I see everyday how important good brain and body fuel is for our students.

shortfalls in children’s diets and to help address the current high rates of obesity and chronic disease. We
want the best nutrition for all children, particularly low?income children who may lack access to
consistent healthy, quality food outside of school.  
The new USDA nutrition standards for school meals are extraordinarily important for the health and
academic success of America’s school children. Thirty million children eat lunch at school every day; more
than 21 million of them are low?income children whose families are struggling to make ends meet. Nearly
15 million children (12 million of them low?income) eat school breakfast every day. Research shows that
the new standards have a positive impact on the school nutrition environment as well as student food
selection and consumption, especially for fruits and vegetables.  
We are concerned about the proposed changes to the school nutrition standards, and strongly support
maintaining the current, evidence?based school meal program standards to assure that all children have
access to foods that support their health, wellbeing, and learning, irrespective of the school they attend.  
School meals should be consistent with the Dietary Guidelines for Americans, including serving whole?
grain foods and limiting sodium and saturated fat. This is especially important because most American
children do not consume enough fiber and whole grains, and consume too much sodium and fat. The
majority of schools are fully and successfully meeting the current nutrition requirements already; this is
not a time for rolling back the standards.  
To ensure that children get the full value from the new healthier school meals, we offer these
recommendations to increase the reach of the school nutrition programs:  
? ensure that students who are eligible for free and reduced?price school meals are certified by
working with states to improve and strengthen direct certification systems, and address any
barriers in the school meal application process;  
? encourage schools to offer free breakfast and lunch to all students through the Community
Eligibility Provision, and any other federal provisions that are available to schools; and  
? promote breakfast in the classroom and other alternative school breakfast models.  
We encourage USDA to continue its excellent nutrition education (e.g., Team Nutrition), program
technical assistance, training, and education initiatives.

to submit comments in response to the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) “Child
Nutrition Programs: Flexibilities for Milk, Whole Grains, and Sodium Requirements”
interim final rule (IFR) (82 FR 56703). While we applaud the USDA in its efforts to facilitate
sodium reduction in the nation’s child nutrition programs, we strongly oppose any further
delay in the implementation of this critically important public health initiative. Founded in
1952, ASPHN is a non-profit organization that provides leadership on food and nutrition
policy, programs and services to improve the health of the American people through good
nutrition. ASPHN’s membership is composed of more than 300 public health nutritionists
working in state and local government agencies in all 50 states, the District of Columbia,
and five U.S. territories. ASPHN’s mission is that healthy eating and active living become the
easy and natural choices for all Americans.
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC, 2014), close to ninety
percent of U.S. children ages 6 to 18 years consume too much sodium daily. Excess dietary
sodium is directly associated with elevated blood pressure in children. Rosner, Cook,
Daniels, and Falkner (2013) estimate that one out of every six American children, ages 8–
17 years, have either pre–high blood pressure or high blood pressure (Rosner et al., 2013).
Children diagnosed with higher blood pressure are at greater risk of developing adult
hypertension; along with heart disease, stroke, and debilitating kidney disease. The risk is
even greater for children who are overweight or obese (CDC, 2014). After studying
different groups of children, Aburto et al. (2013) ascertained that lowering sodium intake
reduces high blood pressure. Along with Allen et al. (2014), Chen and Wang (2008), and
Mennella (2014), ASPHN urges the USDA to place a robust emphasis on more timely
cardio-vascular prevention strategies via healthier food options for American children andimplementing the sodium targets restrictions in child nutrition programs without further
postponement.
The ever-increasing rates of hypertension in America’s child and adult population are
intensified by a spectrum of adverse healthcare costs and consequences. Researchers
Kaelber et al. (2016) project a ten percent reduction in sodium intake in the diets of
children and teenagers will avert millions of cardiac events and save billions of healthcare
dollars. Instead of impeding public health efforts to lower sodium in school meals, USDA
must redouble its efforts to improve America’s children’s health and ultimately the health
of our nation. ASPHN ardently urges the USDA to vigorously enforce the phased sodium
reductions in school meals as stipulated in the Healthy Hunger-Free Kids Act (HHFKA).
Many of the children in the USDA child nutrition programs consume 50% or more of their
daily calories at school (Stallings, Suitor, and Taylor 2010). Therefore, it is imperative that
foods served in USDA child nutrition programs meet proposed nutrient requirements,
support good health, sustain adequate growth, and bring about life-long healthy eating
habits (Story, Nanney, & Schwartz, 2009). US Dietary Guidelines recommend a reduced
sodium intake in children. The 2010 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee articulated its
concern for excess sodium intake during childhood as blood pressure tracks over time. The
2015 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee Report stated that over and above the other
nutrients surveyed, sodium intake disrupts the Healthy Eating Index for children (Appel et
al., 2015).
The social, economic and generational health benefits of reducing sodium intake in children
are achievable. So far, more than 90 percent of America’s child nutrition programs have
come into compliance with USDA’s proposed meal standards. What is more ASPHN agrees
with the American Heart Association’s (AHA, 2017) that instead of rescheduling sodium
regulations, USDA must allocate sufficient resources, staff training, technical assistance and
demonstrated strategies to those remaining child nutrition programs that are still
struggling to meet the designated sodium targets. To its credit the food industry has shown
some progress in lowering sodium content to meet the current school meals standards.
Still, USDA can further support this process by incentivizing the school food industry to
increase its offering of diverse, and culturally appropriate lower-sodium and whole grain
products that students would take pleasure in eating; while at the same time reducing plate
waste.
In view of the extensive impact of hypertension on both young and older Americans today,
ASPHN staunchly supports prevention strategies that target children. Time is of the essence. By instituting sodium restrictions in child nutrition programs without delay, USDA
will be helping children, and their families, reach daily sodium intakes as recommended by
the Institute of Medicine and the Dietary Guidelines for Americans. Most importantly,
USDA’s expeditious enactment of the sodium targets for child nutrition programs, will
assuredly have an irrefutable impact on our nation’s health and the health of American
children.

Re: Docket No.  FNS-2017-0021; Child Nutrition Programs: Flexibilities for Milk, Whole Grains, and Sodium Requirements
Public Health Advocates opposes weakening school nutrition standards.  Schools participating in the National School Lunch and Breakfast Programs are making great progress toward serving healthier meals for low-income children with less sodium; more whole grains, fruits, and vegetables; and no trans-fat; and removing sugary drinks and unhealthy snack food.   The 2012 updates to school nutrition standards reflect sound science and support children's health.
The revised school nutrition standard is arguably one of the most important obesity prevention policy achievements because researchers estimate that these improvements prevent more than 2 million cases of childhood obesity and save up to $792 million in health-care related costs over ten years.  However, the proposed changes in the IFR could jeopardize this progress.
Public Health Advocates opposes the proposed three-year delay (from School Year 2017-2018 to School Year 2021-2022) of the second sodium reduction targets (Target 2) for school meals and of the third phase of the sodium reduction (Target 3).  The delay seems unnecessary since many schools, food service companies, and others in industry are working toward or already providing healthy and appealing meals and products with less sodium.  USDA should address remaining challenges through training and technical assistance.  
Public Health Advocates urges discontinuing the whole-grains waiver. The waiver is unnecessary because according to USDA, 85 percent of schools have not requested waivers and are providing children with appealing whole-grain options.  
Public Health Advocates opposes allowing flavored low-fat (1 percent) milk for school meals and as a competitive food.  Research supports not allowing flavored low-fat milk because it would provide more calories and likely exceed the calorie maximum for school meals. The current consensus recommendations is to only serve plain fat-free and low-fat milk to children and adolescents.  However, if USDA allows flavored low-fat milk, we recommend a calorie cap of no more than 130 calories per 8 ounces.
We oppose further delay of the sodium reduction targets (both Target 2 and Target 3), the continuation of the whole-grains waiver, and allowing flavored low-fat milk.  Rather than weakening school nutrition standards, we urge the administration to support efforts to continue the progress to improve school food.

I respectfully submit comment regarding the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Child Nutrition Programs: Flexibilities for Milk, Whole Grains, and Sodium Requirements interim final rule (IFR) (82 FR 56703). 
Slow Food USA believes that everyone, and most importantly our children, have a right to enjoy, ample, sustainably and humanely produced food that is good for human and environmental health and for those who produce our food.  For the sake of our children, I strongly oppose weakening school nutrition standards.  Virtually all schools, 99 percent, participating in the National School Lunch and Breakfast Programs are making significant progress in serving healthier meals to our children - with less sodium, more whole grains, fruits, and vegetables, and no trans-fat - and curtailing access to sugary drinks and unhealthy snack food.   
Sodium
I oppose the proposed three-year delay of the second school meals sodium reduction targets (Target 2), from School Year 2017/18 to School Year 2021/22, that would lock in unsafe levels of sodium in our childrens diets.  
Whole Grains
I oppose the continuation of whole-grain waivers.  USDA provides in the IFR that 85 percent of schools are providing children with appealing whole-grain options and have not requested waivers.  Eating more whole grains is associated with reduced risk of heart disease, 
Flavored Milk
I oppose allowing flavored low-fat (1 percent) milk in school meals and as a competitive food.  The current standards that allow plain or flavored fat-free milk and plain low-fat milk are based on expert recommendations from the National Academy of Medicines 2009 report

Blocks for Healthy Children.3
The Harvard University T.H. Chan School of Public Health concluded that the
update to school nutrition standards is ""one of the most important national
obesity prevention policy achievements in recent decades.""4 Researchers
estimate that improvement in school nutrition standards have prevented more
than 2 million cases of childhood obesity and save up to $792 million in healthcare related costs over ten years. With one out of three children and adolescents aged 2 to 19 years is overweight
or obese5·
6 and children consuming one-third to one-half of daily calories during
the school day/ good school nutrition is critical to child health and school
success. The changes proposed in the IFR would could jeopardize this progress.
We are most concerned about the following items:
1. The three-year delay in the second sodium reduction levels would harm
children 's health
We oppose the proposed three-year delay (from School Year 2017-2018 to
School Year 2021 -2022) of the second sodium reduction targets (Target 2) for
school meals that would lock in unsafe levels of sodium for children.
Unfortunately, nine out often children consume too much sodium,8 increasing
their risk of high blood pressure, heart disease, and stroke.9 Many schools, food
service companies, and others in industry are working toward or already
providing healthy and appealing meals and products with less sodium. USDA
should address remaining challenges through training and technical assistance.
Delaying the second phase of sodium reduction puts children's health at risk and
would result in children consuming an extra 84 to 98 teaspoons of salt (over the
course of the three-year delay).
1 ° Further, we are opposed to any delay of the
third and final phase of sodium reduction for school meals (Target 3 which is
supposed to go into effect School Year 2022-2023).
2. Continuing the whole-grains waiver is unnecessmy
There is no need to continue the whole-grain waivers. USDA concedes in the
IFR that 85 percent of schools have not requested waivers and are providing
children with appealing whole-grain options. If all schools in Alabama, Idaho,
and Montana can serve whole grains to their students, schools in the rest of the
states should be able to as well. 11 Eating more whole grains is associated with
reduced risk of heart disease, stroke, and diabetes, provides more nutrients, and are a healthful source of fiber. 12 Children, on average, consume too few whole
grains and too many refined grainsY
3. Allowing.flavored low-fat milk is inconsistent with expert dietary advice
and school needs
We oppose allowing flavored low-fat (l percent) milk for school meals and as a
competitive food. The current standards that allow plain or flavored fat-free
milk and plain low-fat milk are based on expert recommendations from the
National Academy of Medicine's 2009 report. 14 The recommendations
disallowed flavored low-fat milk because it would provide more calories and
likely exceed the calorie maximum for school meals. The 20 15 DGA similarly
recommended, ""increasing the proportion of dairy intake that is fat-free or lowfat milk"" and ""reducing the intake of added sugars"" such as those in flavored
milk. 15 Similarly, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation's Healthier Beverage
Guidelines recommend only plain fat-free and low-fat milk for children and
adolescents. 16 Further, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation panel
recommended that if schools offered flavored low-fat milk, it should be no more
than 130 calories per 8 ounces. If USDA allows flavored low-fat milk, we
recommend a calorie cap of no more than 130 calories per 8 ounces, consistent
with the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation 's Healthier Beverage Guidelines.
Conclusion
We oppose further delay of the sodium reduction targets (both Target 2 and
Target 3), the continuation of the whole-grains waiver, and allowing flavored
low-fat milk. Rather than weakening school nutrition standards. We urge the

In King County, Washington, our schools have been engaged over the past eight years in
implementing the new nutrition standards under the Healthy Hunger Free Kids including
increasing fruits and vegetables, increasing whole grains, and reducing sodium in the meals they
serve every day. All King County school districts have made great progress toward meeting
these standards.
1 Some school districts are already meeting the target 2 guidelines ahead of
schedule.
Public Health – Seattle & King County (PHSKC) has been committed to working with King
County school districts given that one out of five of the over 280,000 school aged children and
adolescents in King County is overweight or obese.
4 Under a current CDC funded grant, PHSKC
is working with school districts on reducing sodium in school meals beyond Target 1 through
changes in procurement, revamped recipes and staff trainings focused on flavor enhancement.
Providing this type of dedicated technical assistance along with engaging champions like school
nutrition directors has been shown to be key to successfully making policy and environmental changes in schools and other settings.
5 One King County district, Highline Public Schools, has
made great efforts to reduce sodium in their school meals by moving to scratch cooking,
purchasing local produce, and even baking their own bread. District staff have also worked with
their suppliers to substitute lower sodium food products for popular items like ketchup,
hamburger patties, and tomato soup. These products are available because of the push of the
existing requirements to reduce sodium. We are concerned that delaying sodium reduction levels
could lead to industry halting efforts to innovate, reformulate and price competitively, and
halting school efforts that would otherwise have met the targets.(need citation)

Agriculture (USDA) to express strong opposition to the weakening of evidence-based school
nutrition standards and to the proposed policy changes contained in the “Child Nutrition
Programs: Flexibilities for Milk, Whole Grains, and Sodium Requirements” interim final
rule.
UCS is a science-based nonprofit working for a healthy environment and a safer world. Our
organization combines independent scientific research and citizen action to develop
innovative, practical solutions to some of the nation’s most pressing challenges and secure
responsible changes in government policy, corporate practices, and consumer choices.
The nutrition standards established by the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010 (HHFKA)
rely on evidence-based federal nutrition guidelines to support healthy behaviors and reduce
long-term risk of chronic disease among our nation’s children. The proposed changes to these
nutrition standards contradict the best available nutritional science and the 2015-2020 Dietary
Guidelines for Americans, which explicitly recommend a healthy eating pattern that includes
whole grains and limits saturated fats, added sugars, and sodium. The current state of US
population health demands that we take these recommendations seriously: two thirds of all
adults in the US are overweight or obese, and about half live with one or more preventable
diseases.
1 The medical costs associated with obesity now account for an estimated 21 percent
of all national health expenditures.2 We can’t afford to let our children—nearly one in six of
whom are overweight or obese—follow in our footsteps.3
Among the stated aims of the proposed rule are to address significant challenges faced by
school food operators and to ensure that children are served nutritious and appealing meals.
However, USDA reports that more than 99 percent of schools nationwide are already meeting the HHFKA standards.4 Furthermore, studies have reported increased fruit and vegetable
consumption among kids, higher school meal participation, and no change in food waste in
the years following adoption of the new nutrition standards.5 As the federal agency
responsible for overseeing child nutrition programs, the USDA has played a critical role in
providing resources and assistance to help schools meet new standards and to help students
learn healthy eating behaviors, and must continue to do so.
Children consume more than half of their daily calories at school; for low-income and foodinsecure children, this is likely a severe underestimate.
6 With more than 45 million students
eating meals and snacks at school each day, school meals offer a critical opportunity to
support healthy behaviors and reduce long-term chronic disease risk—making evidencebased school nutrition standards one of the best public health tools at our disposal.7,8 Studies
suggest that the HHFKA is one of the most effective strategies for reducing childhood
obesity and predict the policy will prevent more than 2 million cases over the span of ten
years, leading researchers at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health to name it “one
of the most important national obesity prevention policy achievements in recent decades.”9
Weakening the nutrition standards established in the HHFKA by permitting the use of whole
grain waivers, delaying sodium targets, and allowing milk choices with higher levels of
added sugar and saturated fat diminishes our ability to achieve these public health gains. It is
essential that any changes to school meals program represent the best available science and
are free of unsubstantiated influence that may work against the interests of our nation’s
children.
Thank you for your careful consideration of the comments on the “Child Nutrition Programs:
Flexibilities for Milk, Whole Grains, and Sodium Requirements” interim final rule. Rather
than weakening child nutrition programs, we urge the USDA to continue providing the
critical support schools need to implement the current science-based standards that offer

registered voters agreed that public schools should be required to provide foods made from whole
grains.11 This is a snapshot of the positive public sentiment reflected across the country in support of
improved nutrition standards for foods served to students in schools.
A three-year delay in the second sodium reduction levels will harm children’s health
We oppose the proposed three-year delay (from School Year 2017-2018 to School Year 2021-2022) of
the second sodium reduction targets (Target 2) for school meals that would lock in higher levels of
sodium for children. Unfortunately, nine out of ten children consume too much sodium,12 increasing their
risk of high blood pressure, heart disease, and stroke.13 Many schools, food service companies, and
industry players are working toward or already providing nutritious and appealing foods with less sodium.
We recommend that the USDA address remaining challenges that schools are facing with targeted
training and technical assistance. By delaying the second phase of sodium reduction, children will
consume an extra 84 to 98 teaspoons of salt (over the course of the three-year delay).14
 Further, we are
opposed to any delay of the third and final phase of sodium reduction for school meals (Target 3), which
is supposed to go into effect during School Year 2022-2023.
Continuing the whole-grains waiver is unnecessary
According to the USDA, “whole grains give kids B vitamins, minerals, and fiber to help them feel full
longer so they stay alert to concentrate at school.”15 Additionally, the USDA’s MyPlate food guidance
encourage individuals to “make at least half your grains whole grains” and cites whole grains as a source
of magnesium - a mineral used in building bones and particularly important for growing youth. Whole
grains provide a variety of essential nutrients, including iron and folate. When consumed as part of an
overall healthy diet, consumption of whole grains can help reduce the risk of some chronic diseases such
as heart disease, obesity, and Type 2 diabetes.16 For all these reasons, it is paramount that the whole grainrich nutrition standards remain a requirement in the National School Lunch and School Breakfast
Programs.
Not only do whole grain-rich product provide great health benefits, they are also readily available to
schools and appealing to students. As of January 2018, the Alliance for a Healthier Generation’s Smart
Food Planner, an online database that features food and beverage products that align with federal nutrition
standards, showed that, at a minimum, more than 874 whole grain-rich products are currently available
for purchase by schools.17 Further, the USDA website states, “there are many products that meet the whole grain-rich criteria that are already available to schools to make foods such as rice bowls,
sandwiches, wraps, and more.”18 National organizations that work directly with schools have seen this
data come to life through meals planned and served by schools across the country. Many schools across
the U.S. are offering whole grain-rich products on their menus that students enjoy. Successful strategies
for encouraging students to eat more whole grains include student surveys, samples and taste tests,
experimenting with new products and recipes, and peer-to-peer sharing of food preparation techniques.
The IFR reverses the great progress schools have already made in promoting a healthier lifestyle, a
healthy weight, and health equity for every child. Schools need federal guidance and support to continue
offering meals that nourish students, an investment in our children’s health that will prepare the next
generation for success. Instead of lowering standards for all schools, the USDA should provide additional
training and technical assistance to the minority of districts that receive waivers and are having difficulty
meeting the whole grain-rich requirements.
Allowing flavored low-fat milk is inconsistent with dietary advice and school needs
We oppose allowing flavored low-fat (1 percent) milk for school meals and as a competitive food. The
current standards that allow plain or flavored fat-free milk and plain low-fat milk are based on expert

2017,FNS-2017-0021-7135,nan,Academic researchers,"The American College of Preventive Medicine (ACPM) appreciates the opportunity to respond
to the United States Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) Food and Nutrition Service (FNS)
interim final rule (82 FR 56703), “Child Nutrition Programs: Flexibilities for Milk, Whole
Grains, and Sodium Requirements.”
The American College of Preventive Medicine is the national medical specialty society of
physicians dedicated to disease prevention, health promotion, and systems-based healthcare
improvement. Established in 1954, ACPM is the leading U.S.-based physician organization
focused on practice, research, publication, and teaching of evidence-based preventive medicine.
ACPM’s members are leaders in a variety of health settings, including state and local health
departments, federal agencies, hospitals, health plans, community and migrant health centers,
industrial sites, occupational health centers, academic centers, private practice, and the military.
Our members have the skills needed to understand and reduce the risks of disease, disability, and
death at the population, community, and individual levels.
ACPM also is a leader in advancing the practice of lifestyle medicine, having created a
comprehensive curriculum for physicians on topics including nutrition, physical activity, sleep,
stress management, tobacco cessation, and coaching behavior change. ACPM’s lifestyle
medicine initiative teaches physicians how to prescribe nutrition to patients and families, which
embraces the concepts in the 2012 Nutrition Standards in the National School Lunch and School
Breakfast Programs.
ACPM opposes the interim final rule that weakens school nutrition standards and recommends
that the FNS continue enforcement of the 2012 updates to school nutrition standards, including
standards for milk, whole grains, and sodium requirements.
In October of 2017, the National Center for Health Statistics released findings that the
prevalence of obesity has reached 39.8% in adults and 18.5% in youth; the highest rate the
country has ever seen in all adults.1 Obesity carries with it several health risks, including increased risks for type 2 diabetes,2,3
cardiovascular disease,4,5
and respiratory disease6
, among
many others.
Not only does obesity lead to chronic disease, but children who have obesity are more likely to
become adults with obesity.7 A child with obesity is more likely to have an increased severity of
obesity and disease risk factors in adulthood.8
The issue of obesity leads to over $200 billion in direct health care costs per year.9 Chronic
diseases are a large driver of healthcare costs in the U.S., but early prevention interventions,
especially in childhood, can lead to saved costs to our healthcare system, as well as fewer
medical complications in adulthood. Researchers at the Harvard University T.H. Chan School of
Public Health found that “setting nutrition standards for school meals … reach a very large
population of children and have a substantial impact: an estimated 1,816,000 cases of childhood
obesity would be prevented” and it would cause “the largest reduction in childhood obesity
prevalence” of all interventions studied.10 The researchers added that “the improvements in meal
standards in the National School Lunch and School Breakfast Programs as well as
implementation of the first meaningful national standards for all other foods and beverages sold
in schools make the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act one of the most important national obesity
prevention policy achievements in recent decades.”10 Further, the Community Guide, a collection
of evidence-based findings from the Community Preventive Services Task Force, also
recommends meal interventions in schools, including school policies that adhere to the 2012
school nutrition standards.11
Weakening the standards of the Child Nutrition Programs in schools is a step back in the fight to
prevent childhood obesity and promote healthy children.
Allowing flavored low-fat milk would undercut recommended dietary advice.The National Academy of Medicine’s 2009 report, on which the current standards are based,
already studied the advantages and disadvantages of retaining flavored milk. The committee
recommended retaining flavored fat-free milk, noting that flavored low-fat milk would provide
more calories and would likely result in menus that exceed calorie maximums.12
Although one eight ounce flavored milk typically adds two-thirds of the American Heart
Association’s recommended added sugar consumption for children per day13, the benefits of
drinking flavored milk, including nutrient intake, are enough to recommend allowing fat-free
flavored milk. The added calories in low-fat flavored milk, however, directly impact obesity
rates and should not be an additional option for school children. The 2015 Dietary Guidelines for
Americans also supports “reducing the intake of added sugars,” such as those in flavored milk.14
Waiving whole-grains requirements would be a setback in the progress already made by
many schools. USDA has noted that 85 percent of schools have not requested waivers and are
already providing children with whole-grain options. Some states do not have any schools
requesting waivers, including Alabama, Idaho, and Montana, and other states, such as Arkansas,
Maryland, and Rhode Island, do not allow waivers.15 The Alliance for a Healthier Generation’s
Smart Food Planner shows that there are approximately 874 whole grain-rich products currently
available for purchase by schools.16 ACPM joins with other organizations to call for additional
assistance and training to the few school districts that have trouble meeting the requirements,
instead of allowing waivers that will continue to imperil the health of children.
The three-year delay in the second sodium reduction levels will contribute to the rise in
chronic disease among children. The American Heart Association recommends Americans
ingest no more than 2,300 milligrams (mg) of sodium per day, with an ideal limit of less than
1,500 mg per day.17 Currently, per-lunch maximum sodium levels are 1,230 mg in elementary
school, 1,360 mg in middle school, and 1,420 mg in high school. Children are getting up to 50-
60% of the total recommended sodium each day in just one meal, provided by schools. School
meals are contributing to the 9 out of 10 children in the U.S. that eat more sodium than
recommended, which on average is about 3,300 mg per day.18 A diet high in sodium can lead to
high blood pressure, which today affects 1 in 6 children.18 High blood pressure can also lead to
increased risk of coronary heart disease, heart failure, stroke, kidney failure, gastric cancer, and
osteoporosis.19
The public wants healthier school choices.One criticism of the 2012 updates to school nutrition standards is that children won’t eat
healthier foods, leading to increased food waste. This has not found to be the case in studies on
the topic, however. In fact, the new standards have led to an increased consumption of vegetables
and fruits by school children, and no additional waste.20 The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation
reports that students taking fruit with lunch has increased by 12% since the new standards were
put in place, and that students are eating 18% more vegetables and 15% more of their entrees.
These standards are popular with students; 70% of elementary and middle school students and
63% of high school students attend schools where food service staff and administrators say
students like healthier lunches.21
In addition, the vast majority of parents of school-age children support strong nutrition standards
for all foods and beverages sold to students during school.22 Seventy-two percent of parents
favor the new standards, with 50% strongly supporting them. This support spans racial lines,
with 68% of whites, 85% of Hispanics, and 91% of African Americans supporting the standards,
and political lines, with 56% of Republicans, 71% or Independents, and 84% of Democrats
supporting the standards.22
Children deserve schools that provide the best opportunities for health and learning. Not only do
the new school nutrition standards improve the opportunity for students to be healthy, the
standards also directly impact academic achievement. A lack of adequate consumption of fruits,
vegetables, and dairy products is associated with lower grades among students.23,24 By continuing
adherence to the 2012 standards, including disallowing flavored low-fat milk, not accepting
waivers for whole-grain standards, and continuing the sodium reduction targets, schools will
promote health and learning within their institutions, and contribute to the fight against obesityrelated diseases that are burdening our healthcare system.
ACPM appreciates the opportunity to comment on this interim final rule, and looks forward to
continuing to work with the Food and Nutrition Service to improve health systems through
prevention and public health.

2017,FNS-2017-0021-7327,nan,Advocacy,"On behalf of more than 8,500 pediatric nurse practitioners (PNPs) and fellow pediatric-focused advanced practice registered nurses (APRNs) committed to providing optimal health care to children, the National Association of Pediatric Nurse Practitioners (NAPNAP) appreciates the opportunity to provide the attached comments on the Department of Agriculture's November 30, 2017, interim final rule, ""Child Nutrition Programs: Flexibilities for Milk, Whole Grains, and Sodium Requirements"" (Docket No. FNS-2017-0021) and state our opposition to policies that would weaken school nutrition standards.  NAPNAP and its members are deeply concerned about the impact on children's health and nutrition of delaying targets for sodium reduction, extending the waiver on whole grains and permitting flavored low-fat milk.
As you may know, APRNs who concentrate on children’s care, including PNPs, have attained enhanced
education in pediatric nursing and health care using evidence based practice guidelines. Committed to
improving children's health, they practice in primary care, specialty, and acute care. Pediatric-focused
APRNs have provided high quality health care to children and families for more than 40 years in an
extensive range of practice settings such as pediatric offices, clinics, schools, and hospitals – reaching
millions of patients across the country each year. NAPNAP members play a crucial role in educating
children and parents about the importance of good nutrition and physical activity to prevent childhood
obesity, diabetes, and chronic health problems related to diet and nutrition. We continue to advocate for
children, parents and families to have access to more nutrition foods and healthy choices in schools.
The National School Lunch and Breakfast Programs are making important progress in serving healthier
meals for low-income children, with virtually every school in the country taking part, providing nutritious
meals with less sodium, more whole grains, fruits, and vegetables, and no trans fat, and removing sugary
drinks and unhealthy snack food. Studies suggest that improvements have prevented more than two million
cases of childhood obesity and saved as much as $792 million in health-care related costs over ten years.
Pediatric-focused APRNs know that better school nutrition is critical to address the national crisis that one
out of every three children and adolescents aged 2 to 19 years is overweight or obese, recognizing that our
children consume one-third to one-half of their daily calories during the school day. However, we are
deeply concerned that, rather than strengthening support for schools and children’s health, the changes
proposed in these regulations could jeopardize recent efforts.
Sodium Reduction Targets
Specifically, NAPNAP opposes the proposed three-year delay (from School Year 2017-2018 to School Year
2021-2022) of the second sodium reduction targets (Target 2) for school meals. This policy would lock in
unsafe levels of sodium for children, further endangering their health. The facts are clear: nine out of ten
children consume too much sodium, increasing their risk of high blood pressure, heart disease, and stroke.Many schools, food service companies, and others in industry are currently working toward or already
providing healthy and appealing meals and products with less sodium. Delaying the second phase of sodium
reduction would threaten that progress and put children’s health at risk: estimates indicate children would
consume an extra 84 to 98 teaspoons of salt over the course of the three-year delay.
In addition, NAPNAP objects to any delay of the third and final phase of sodium reduction for school meals
(Target 3 which is supposed to go into effect School Year 2022-2023). Instead, we urge USDA to focus its
efforts and resources on addressing the remaining challenges in implementing the standards through training
and technical assistance to school and food services providers.
Whole-Grains Waiver
USDA acknowledges in the regulations that 85 percent of schools have not asked for waivers from the
current whole-grain targets and are currently providing children with appealing whole-grain options. Doing
so is important: research has associated eating more whole grains with reduced risk of heart disease, stroke,
and diabetes, improved nutrition, and a healthful source of fiber.
Evidence is clear that children, on average, consume too few whole grains and too many refined grains.
NAPNAP respectfully believes there is no need for USDA to continue the whole-grain waivers. If all
schools in Alabama, Idaho, and Montana can serve whole grains to their students, we believe that schools in
the rest of the states should be able to comply with the policy as well.
Flavored Low-Fat Milk
As you know, current school nutrition standards allow plain or flavored fat-free milk and plain low-fat milk,
based on expert recommendations from the National Academy of Medicine’s 2009 report. That report did
not support the inclusion of flavored low-fat milk because it would increase children’s calorie intake and
most likely exceed the calorie maximum for school meals. The 2015 Dietary Guidelines for Americans
similarly recommended “increasing the proportion of dairy intake that is fat-free or low-fat milk” and
“reducing the intake of added sugars” such as those in flavored milk. In addition, the Healthier Beverage
Guidelines released by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation recommend only plain fat-free and low-fat
milk for children and adolescents.
Based on the evidence of nutrition research, NAPNAP opposes allowing flavored low-fat (one percent) milk
for school meals and as a competitive food. Further, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation panel
recommended that if schools offered flavored low-fat milk, it should be no more than 130 calories per 8
ounces. If USDA decides to allow flavored low-fat milk, we believe a limit of no more than 130 calories per
8 ounces should be enforced, consistent with research recommendations.
In summary, NAPNAP opposes and further delay of the sodium reduction targets (both Target 2 and Target 3),
the continuation of the whole-grains waiver, and allowing flavored low-fat milk. Rather than weakening school
nutrition standards, we urge the administration to support efforts to continue the progress to improve school
food. We are grateful for the opportunity to provide these comments and hope you will contact NAPNAP for
assistance on any issues or policies related to children’s health and nutrition. We have a wide breath of experts
ready and eager to assist you in framing a healthier future for our children.",In favor of original HHFKA

2017,FNS-2017-0021-7358,nan,Advocacy,"The Pew Charitable Trusts (Pew) is pleased to offer comments on the U.S. Department of
Agriculture’s (USDA) interim final rule, Child Nutrition Programs: Flexibilities for Milk, Whole
Grains, and Sodium Requirements, which extends flexibilities in the Child Nutrition Program for
flavored milk, whole grains, and sodium requirements to School Year (SY) 2021-2022. Pew is
an independent, nonpartisan research and policy organization dedicated to serving the public.
From 2010-2017, we partnered with the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation in creating the Kids'
Safe and Healthful Foods Project (KSHF), which provided nonpartisan analysis and evidencebased recommendations on policies that affect the safety and healthfulness of school foods.
Pew became involved in the effort to improve the nutritional quality of school food because
childhood obesity rates in the United States have risen rapidly over the past four decades, more
than tripling among school-aged children and more than quadrupling among teens.1
Today,
nearly one in three young people are either overweight or obese, placing them at increased risk
for serious diseases, such as diabetes, heart disease, cancer, and stroke.2 Given the high obesityrates among children, schools have a unique opportunity to play a crucial role in supporting the
nutritional health of our nation's children.
In passing the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act (HHFKA) in 2010, Congress reauthorized federal
school meal programs with a strong emphasis on improving children’s access to nutritious foods
and promoting healthy eating. At the time, the average school lunch throughout the nation was
high in sodium, calories, and added sugars.3
The HHFKA shepherded in the first major changes
to school meal nutrition standards in more than 15 years, and helped ensure that future lunch
plates would include more fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.
Since the regulations implementing the HHFKA have gone into effect, schools nationwide have
made great strides in providing healthier options at the lunch table. For example, by September
2016, nearly 99 percent of school districts were meeting the healthier standards put forth in the
HHFKA.
4
Schools are also seeing a greater percentage of students choosing to eat lunches higher
in nutritional quality and lower in calories. For example, one study of middle schoolers in
Connecticut found that the amount of vegetables students consumed in 2014 increased by 18
percentage points, compared with 2012.5
A KSHF report detailing the results of a national survey of nearly 500 school nutrition directors
at the end of SY 2014-2015 sheds light on the successful strategies school districts are
implementing to meet the new requirements. 6
For example, to overcome challenges related to
cost and availability of foods to meet the standards: (1) some school districts have formed foodbuying co-ops with other districts to expand purchasing options for whole grain products; or (2)
moved to more scratch cooking to create menu items with less sodium. Experts on an advisory
panel for this report emphasized the importance of involving students in the menu-planning
process to increase their acceptance of new foods or new variations of traditional menu items.
Pew believes the USDA’s decision in the interim final rule to continue the whole grain waivers
and delay sodium reduction targets for three additional years undermines the progress made to
date in improving the health and wellbeing of the more than 30 million children who benefit
from school meals each day. USDA’s interim final rule weakens school nutrition standards and is inconsistent with science-based recommendations. To maximize the positive impact of school
nutrition standards, and to ensure that the regulations work as intended, we urge USDA to
reconsider its decisions regarding the whole grain waivers and the sodium reduction targets.
Whole Grain Waivers
The interim final rule allows individual school food authorities to continue exemptions from
serving whole grain-rich products in the weekly menu through SY 2021-2022. Pew believes that
this approach is inconsistent with the intent of the HHFKA and runs counter to
recommendations made in the National Academy of and Medicine (formerly the Institute of
Medicine) 2009 evidence-based analysis, “School Meals: Building Blocks for Healthy Children”
and the “2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans” (2015-2020 DGA), which recommend
that Americans consume half of their grains as whole grains.7 Before the whole grain standards
were finalized in 2014, just seven percent of children were meeting the Dietary Guidelines
recommendations and whole grains were rarely included on school menus—featured in just five
percent of breads, rolls, or bagels on school breakfast and lunch menus.8
The whole grain-rich requirements are working. As noted in the preamble to the interim final
rule, 85 percent of schools have not requested waivers and are providing children with appealing
whole grain options. By enforcing this standard, and requiring all schools to serve whole grainrich foods, the USDA has the potential to more than double children’s whole grain consumption.
Rather than allow exemptions, we encourage USDA to instead, provide additional training and
technical assistance to the small number of school districts that are having difficulty meeting the
whole grain-rich requirements.
Sodium Reduction
The interim final rule also proposes delaying sodium reduction targets beyond Target 1 until SY
2021-2022. While we have supported USDA’s tiered approach to decreasing the sodium content
of foods served to children in school, we are concerned that any delay in future sodium reduction
targets impedes the important progress made to reduce the unhealthy sodium levels in school
meals. In the United States, nine out of ten children consume an overabundance of sodium in their diet.9
Specifically, children consume between 2,500 to 4,200 mg of sodium per day—well
beyond the 1,900 to 2,300 mg of sodium per day recommended by the 2015-2020 DGA. These
unhealthy levels of dietary sodium put our nation’s children at increased risk of life-threatening
diseases, such as high blood pressure, heart disease, and stroke.10
There is more work to be done to reduce sodium levels in the diets of school-aged children. For
example, at the current Target 1 sodium levels, an elementary school lunch has on average 1,230
mg or about two-thirds of a day’s worth of sodium for a child in a single meal. Similarly, a high
school lunch has on average 1,420 mg, or about half a day’s worth of sodium. Delaying the
second phase of sodium reduction could have far-reaching consequences, resulting in children
consuming an additional 194,250 to 227,550 mg of sodium over the course of the proposed
three-year delay.11
We agree with USDA’s decision to review the sodium reduction targets when the “2020-2025
Dietary Guidelines for Americans” (2020-2025 DGA) are released, in order to ensure that the
targets reflect the most current scientific evidence. That decision, however should not impact the
prompt implementation of the Target 2 sodium standards. We are confident that the 2020-2025
DGA recommendations will support further reductions in sodium levels, as has been the case
with all the Dietary Guidelines since the first edition was released in 1980. We believe that
USDA should reverse its decision in the interim final rule and move forward with the tiered
sodium reductions in the regulations while continuing to support schools’ efforts to work toward
meeting existing Dietary Guidelines sodium recommendations.

2017,FNS-2017-0021-7406,nan,Advocacy,"This rule allows Program operators in the NSLP, SBP, SMP, and CACFP (the Child Nutrition Programs (CNPs)) the option to offer flavored, low-fat (1 percent fat) milk as part of a reimbursable meal for students in grades K through 12, and for SMP and CACFP participants 6 years of age and older. Schools may also offer flavored, low-fat milk as a competitive beverage for sale. This optional flexibility expands the variety of milk in the CNPs and may encourage children's consumption of fluid milk nationwide.
 
No comment
 
This rule allows State agencies to continue granting an SFA's exemption request to use specific alternative grain products if the SFA can demonstrate hardship(s) in procuring, preparing, or serving specific products that are acceptable to students and compliant with the whole grain-rich requirement. This rule responds to challenges experienced by some SFAs with the purchase, preparation, or service of products that comply with the whole grain-rich requirement in the NSLP and SBP.
 
The members of the Urban School Food Alliance have successfully implemented the use of whole grain rich products and support the continued requirement that all grain products be whole grain rich as originally defined.
 
This rule retains Sodium Target 1 as the regulatory limit in the NSLP and SBP through the end of SY 2018-2019. Currently, USDA anticipates retaining Target 1 in the final rule through at least the end of SY 2020-2021 to provide SFAs more time to procure and introduce lower sodium food products, allow food industry more time for product development and reformulation, and give students more time to adjust to school meals with lower sodium content. Also, USDA anticipates that the sodium requirement will continue to be reevaluated for consistency with the Dietary Guidelines, which are updated every five years, and in response to Congressional action, as appropriate. To help inform the final rule, USDA seeks public comments on the long-term availability of this flexibility and its impact on the sodium reduction timeline established in 2012 and, specifically, the impact on Sodium Target 2.
The members of the Urban School Food Alliance have successfully implemented Target 1 sodium requirements and are working towards implementing sodium 2 targets (many of our districts have successfully implemented sodium 2 targets for over a year).  We applaud the food industry, who are successfully making improvements to many products so that they are lower in sodium and acceptable to our students.  We encourage the USDA to implement sodium 2 targets at a future date.

RE: Docket ID FNS-2017-0021
Dear Ms. Namian:
The Afterschool Alliance is a non-profit organization working with over 26,000 partners to ensure that all children and youth have access to quality afterschool and summer learning opportunities that keep children safe and well-nourished, and provide engaging, hands-on activities that raise school attendance, academic achievement and graduation rates. Over the past several years we have worked closely with local, state and national partners to increase the number of young people who have access to nutritious afterschool and summer meals, as well as age-appropriate physical activity, during out of school time programs.  We appreciate the opportunity to comment on the proposed changes to school meal nutrition standards. 
Research shows that the school nutrition standards implemented in the past five years have had a positive impact on the school nutrition environment as well as student food selection and consumption, especially for fruits and vegetables. We are concerned about the proposed changes to the school nutrition standards, and strongly support maintaining the current, evidence-based school meal program standards to assure that all children have access to foods that support their health, well-being, and learning, irrespective of the school they attend.
School meals should be consistent with the Dietary Guidelines for Americans, including serving whole-grain foods and limiting sodium and saturated fat. The majority of schools are fully and successfully meeting the current nutrition requirements already; this is not a time for rolling back the standards. The great progress that has been made in offering nutritious meals and snacks afterschool should not be undermined by rolling back school day meal standards. Afterschool programs that voluntarily adopted the National AfterSchool Association Standards for Healthy Eating and Physical Activity have the potential to be impacted by any weakening of school nutrition standards. This could be the case in particular for the 90 percent of 21st Century Community Learning Centers that are located on school grounds
To ensure that children get the full value from the new healthier school meals, we offer these recommendations to increase the reach of the school nutrition programs:
 Encourage and incentivize all eligible schools and programs to offer CACFP At-Risk Afterschool Meals
 Streamline the CACFP At-Risk Afterschool Meals and Summer Food Service Programs to reduce bureaucratic barriers for programs seeking to provide meals outside of school hours year round; and
Encourage use of the National AfterSchool Associations Healthy Eating and Physical Activity standards to promote physical activity and nutrition education in afterschool and summer learning programs that offer meals. 
We encourage USDA to continue its excellent nutrition education (e.g., Team Nutrition), program technical assistance, training, and education initiatives.
In summary, we are concerned about proposed revisions to the school meal standards. Our nations children need and deserve strong, evidence-based nutrition standards that support their learning, health, and well-being.

shortfalls in children's diets-especially for low-income children who may lack access to
consistent healthy, quality food outside of school-and to help address the current high rates of
obesity and chronic disease.
The new USDA nutrition standards for school meals are critical for the health and academic
success of America's school children. Thirty million children eat lunch at school every day; more
than 21 million of them are low-income children whose families are struggling to make ends
meet. Nearly 15 million children (12 million of them low-income) eat school breakfast every day.
Research shows that the new standards have a positive impact on the school nutrition
environment as well as student food selection and consumption, especially for fruits and

who struggle to feed their families the fresh, healthy food their bodies require, school meals
provide crucial support, and it is necessary to enforce and expand healthy guidelines for the
meals that can be served in schools across the U.S. To ensure that children get the full value from the new healthier school meals, we offer these
recommendations to increase the reach of the school nutrition programs:
• ensure that students who are eligible for free and reduced-price school meals are
certified by working with states to improve and strengthen direct certification systems,
and address any barriers in the school meal application process;
• encourage schools to offer free breakfast and lunch to all students through the
Community Eligibility Provision, and any other federal provisions that are available to
schools; and
• promote breakfast in the classroom and other alternative school breakfast models.
We encourage USDA to continue its excellent nutrition education (e.g., Team Nutrition), program

According to a 2016 analysis of national health survey data, over 90 percent of children in the
U.S. eat sodium at levels in excess of dietary guidelines.9
 High dietary sodium levels are
associated with high blood pressure,10 including in children.11
 High blood pressure in childhood
is associated with high blood pressure in adulthood, early development of heart disease, and
premature death.12
The original timeline for reduction of sodium levels in school meals struck a reasonable balance
between addressing children’s health and giving industry, schools, and children time to adjust to
new formulations. And, indeed, many more low-sodium products that meet Target 2 or even 3
requirements are now available. To the extent that gaps remain, rather than delay this important
public health goal by three years, USDA should provide enhanced technical assistance and
support, including disseminating best practices from those schools and states that have achieved
significant levels of sodium reduction. When the 2020 Dietary Guidelines are released, USDA
should re-evaluate the Target 3 sodium levels to ensure they are consistent with the best
evidence; however, this does not eliminate the need for reducing sodium to moderate Target 2
levels on the original timeline.
Conclusion
Thank you for the opportunity to comment on this interim final rule. We hope that USDA
recognizes the importance of advancing, rather than delaying or reversing, the progress that is
already being made on the health of foods consumed by millions of students across the United
States. We look forward to working with you on this and other activities to improve child and
adult nutrition and health.

2017,FNS-2017-0021-7527,nan,Advocacy,"Consumer Federation of America writes to oppose the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s
(USDA) interim final rule, “Child Nutrition Programs: Flexibilities for Milk, Whole Grains, and
Sodium Requirements.” As we explain in our joint comments with members of the National
Alliance for Nutrition Activity, this rule will weaken school nutrition and exacerbate the
country’s crisis of childhood obesity and diet-related disease. We write separately here to
respond to USDA’s rationale for these rules, including the implicit suggestion that this rule
conforms to congressional intent by anticipating the continuation of delays and exemptions
previously enacted through appropriations riders.
USDA should build on the tremendous progress that the National School Lunch and
Breakfast Programs have made in serving healthier meals with less salt, less fat (and no trans
fat), fewer added sugars, and more fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. Unfortunately, this
interim final rule will foist more products laden with excessive salt, added sugars, and refined
carbohydrates onto the nation’s children. With this rule, USDA has announced three steps
backwards, without the benefit of public comment. First, this rule allows schools to serve more
sugar-sweetened chocolate and other “flavored” milk. Second, it extends exemptions for a small
minority of school food authorities that continue to serve bread, pasta and other “grain products”
that contain less than 50% whole grains, even though these authorities have had over six years
since USDA promulgated the final rule announcing these standards, and three years since the
standards went into effect, to manage their transition to healthier foods. Third, it proposes a
three-year delay on sodium limits. All of these changes would result in more school meals falling
out of line with the most recent Dietary Guidelines for Americans (DGAs).
Under 42 U.S.C. § 1758(a)(4)(B), USDA “shall promulgate rules, based on the most
recent Dietary Guidelines for Americans,” that prescribe the nutritional content of school meals.
USDA does not claim that the delays and exemptions announced in this rule will bring school
nutrition into better alignment with the DGAs. Rather, USDA argues in its federal register notice 
that the changes are necessary “to accommodate menu planning and procurement challenges,
local operational differences, and community preferences,” as well as give “food manufacturers
the certainty they need to engage in product development and reformulation in support of the
whole grain-rich and sodium requirements.” These justifications are undercut by the long history
of the nutrition standards—finalized in January of 2012—and the success with which the vast
majority of schools are already complying with the standards.
Even more problematically, USDA’s notice indicates that the agency’s rule simply
carries out the intent of Congress. However, rather than tying this argument to the application of
an existing law, USDA points to laws that have expired, and the prospect of similar ones that
have yet to be passed. The notice reasons that “Congress recognized the challenges” posed by the
nutrition standards, and for that reason, it passed a series of appropriations riders that provided
carve-outs for flavored milk, whole grains, and sodium requirements. According to the notice,
“[t]his repetitive legislative action manifests a clear Congressional message to USDA: The
current regulatory provisions limiting fluid milk, whole grain-rich, and sodium options in the
[Child Nutrition Programs] are causing operational challenges and need further consideration.”
As the notice points out, the most recent of the riders, enacted September 8, 2017,
extended the carve-outs “through December 8, 2017.” Now, USDA is taking over: “This interim
final rule provides optional flexibilities for SY 2018–2019 in a manner that is consistent with
appropriations legislation in effect for SY 2017–2018 and previous administrative actions.” In
other words, Congress passed legislation to prevent these standards from going into full effect
last year, and now USDA has decided, without the benefit of public comment, to take
administrative action to prevent the standards from going into full effect next year.
As a result, Congress no longer needs to pass an appropriations rider, or other legislation,
to obstruct the standards. USDA suggests that this is unimportant, because Congress would have
passed a law. In particular, USDA’s notice points out that Congress “drafted bills granting
flexibilities in the three areas addressed by this rule—milk, whole grains and sodium,” when it
began the child nutrition program reauthorization process, and those draft bills “reflected
Congress’ interest in providing stakeholders with additional flexibility in these areas.” But of
course, Congress has not passed a child nutrition program reauthorization bill, or a long-term
spending bill, and were it to do so, a majority of members might have conceivably voted against
granting these “flexibilities” again. Even members that previously supported the carve-outs
might have determined that they were no longer necessary, or deferred to constituent concerns,
or calculated that supporting such legislation would do too much to hurt their reelection
prospects.
USDA regulators are not elected. As an Executive Branch agency, the Department
executes the laws passed by Congress. It must ground its actions in statutory authority granted by
Congress, and that statutory authority must still be in force. Under current law, USDA has the
duty to promulgate and enforce school nutrition standards “based on the most recent Dietary
Guidelines for Americans.” 42 U.S.C. § 1758(a)(4)(B). That legislative mandate provided a clear
basis for USDA’s 2012 rule establishing the nutrition standards. What is the legislative basis for
this Interim Final Rule rolling back those standards without the benefit of public comment? The
Department’s Federal Register notice has not made that clear. 
Nor has USDA grounded its decision in sound science. “Product development
challenges” motivate the Department’s abdication on sodium and whole wheat standards, but the
Department cites only “informal conversations” with food manufacturers as evidence of
industry’s need for more flexibility. In defense of chocolate milk, USDA cites declining milk
consumption, but offers only speculation that the nutrition standards’ restrictions on flavored
milk caused the decline, or that the health benefits of drinking more milk offset the harm from
consuming more added sugars. For a 7-year-old child, one carton of chocolate milk accounts for
half the daily limit of sugar recommended by the World Health Organization.1 On sodium, the
Department paradoxically writes off the feasibility of lower sodium in school meals because
“approximately 92 percent of school-age children in the United States exceeded the 2015-2020
Dietary Guidelines upper intake level for dietary sodium,” and “sodium reduction in school
meals must be consistent with broader, overall reductions in the food supply and reductions in
children’s consumption patterns outside of school.” In other words, USDA cannot make school
meals healthier until children adopt healthier diets.
Parents should not have to worry about whether school meals are undermining healthy
eating habits. The law directs USDA to develop school nutrition standards on the basis of the
most recent Dietary Guidelines. The Department did just that in 2012. Congress passed laws to
obstruct the new standards, but those laws have expired. Now, USDA should support the
progress that schools across the country are making towards healthier eating, and fully
implement school nutrition standards. ",In favor of original HHFKA
2017,FNS-2017-0021-7536,nan,Advocacy,"We appreciate the opportunity to comment on the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s (USDA)
proposed School Meal Flexibility Rule. UnidosUS, formerly the National Council of La Raza, is
the nation’s largest Latino civil rights and advocacy organization. Along with our Affiliate
network of nearly 300 local, community based organizations in 41 states, the District of
Columbia, and Puerto Rico, UnidosUS works to build a stronger America by increasing
opportunities for the nation’s 58 million Latinos.
America’s growing Latino child population faces key nutrition-related inequities and
federal school meal programs serve an important role in addressing these challenges
Latino children are projected to account for one of every three children in America by 2050.
Currently, Latino children are more likely to live in low-income, food-insecure households (24
percent), compared to non-Hispanic White children (13 percent).1 Meanwhile, Latino children
experience higher rates of obesity and chronic conditions such as diabetes. In 2015-2016, the
prevalence of obesity among Latino youth was significantly higher than other racial groups: 25.8
percent of Latino youth were found to be obese, compared to 22 percent of non-Hispanic black,
14.1 percent of non-Hispanic white, and 11 percent of non-Hispanic Asian youth.2
School meal programs like the National School Lunch Program (NSLP) and the School
Breakfast Program (SBP) play a vital role in Latino child nutrition and well-being. For example,
Latino children represent nearly a quarter (24 percent) of all children in the NSLP, with
approximately seven million Latino children receiving free and reduced price lunch meals every
day.34
In addition, school meals are the primary source of nutrition for many Latino children.Overall, school-meal programs provide children with a reliable source of nourishment and have
been tied to better educational, health, and behavioral outcomes.
All of these reasons underscore why strong nutrition standards must be upheld. The following
comments are not meant to be exhaustive and focus on key areas of concern, including: milk
flexibility; whole-grain flexibility; and sodium flexibility.
Milk Flexibility
Under the original Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act (HHFKA) rules, flavored milk needs to be
nonfat and 1 percent milk can only be plain. The interim final rule, which allows for flavored
milk with 1 percent fat, would constitute a direct contradiction of the current nutrition guidelines,
and would be inconsistent with the Dietary Guidelines for Americans. This is a regressive move
that would simply allow more unnecessary sugar and calories to be added to children’s diets.
• Recommendation: We urge the USDA to maintain the current guidelines (requiring
that flavored milk remain nonfat) and to provide assistance to the schools struggling
to meet the standard.
Whole Grain-Rich Flexibility
The HHFKA requires that all grains served in school be at least 50 percent whole grain, with the
remaining grain content enriched, and allows for school districts to be able to apply for
exemptions. The USDA has cited a need for flexibility to “serve wholesome, nutritious, and tasty
meals in schools across the nation,” and extends the ability for districts to apply for exemptions.
USDA reports that only a small number of school districts are not currently meeting the nutrition
guidelines for whole grains. Extending this rule through the 2018-19 school year will only hinder
the progress already made.
• Recommendation: We recommend that instead of extending this rule by another
school year, that the USDA provide further guidance and training on how to meet the
whole grain-rich requirement to the remaining 15 percent of schools not currently
complying with this rule.
Sodium Flexibility
While we applaud the USDA’s efforts to decrease the sodium content in school meals, we
oppose further delay of the proposed sodium reduction targets, both Target 2 and Target 3. Nine
out ten children already consume more sodium than the recommended amount for good health,
which highlights the importance of maintaining the current target dates for sodium reduction.5
In
fact, several food companies and school districts already abide by the Target 2 sodium standard.6A delay of the original sodium reduction targets is particularly concerning, given that Mexican
American adolescents have a greater prevalence of high blood pressure compared to nonHispanic whites.7 Delaying of targets could likely exacerbate this issue.
• Recommendation: We strongly oppose the proposed three-year delay (from the 2017-
18 school year to the 2021-22 school year) of the second sodium reduction targets
(Target 2) and oppose any delay of the third and final phase of sodium reduction for
school meals (Target 3, which is scheduled to go into effect in the 2022-23 school
year).
In summary, we are deeply concerned with the USDA’s proposed School Meal Flexibility rule.
Most schools already comply with the final nutrition standards and according to the USDA,
many schools in Los Angeles and Dallas and some of the largest school districts in Florida,
heavily Latino populated school districts, are not only successfully transitioning to the new
standards, they are also seeing increased participation in school meal programs. The interim final
rule will undermine the progress already made and Latino children are some of the most likely to
be impacted by any changes to school nutrition standards.
We urge the USDA to continue the progress to improve school food with strong, evidence-based
nutrition standards America’s children deserve. Thank you for your attention to our comments.

2017,FNS-2017-0021-7540,nan,Advocacy,"We welcome the opportunity to submit these comments to the Department of Agriculture
(“USDA”) in response to its request for comments regarding “Child Nutrition Programs:
Flexibilities for Milk, Whole Grains, and Sodium Requirements” published in the Federal Register on
November 28, 2017. Our companies are very supportive of USDA’s efforts to improve nutrition
standards for the National School Lunch Program (“NSLP”) and the School Breakfast Program
(‘SBP”).
Committed to being leaders in health and nutrition, our companies have voluntarily initiated
numerous efforts to further health and nutrition goals, including working to reduce sodium in our
products and encouraging people to consume more whole grains. Our national non-communicable
disease epidemic requires that industry and government work together to help consumers make
meaningful changes in their diet and exercise habits to improve overall health. It is critical that
consumers have access to fact-based information about the nutrient content of the foods they eat,
and that consumers have a wide variety of nutrient-rich foods from which to choose to more easily
maintain a well-balanced diet.
USDA’s updated school nutrition standards are important to ensure that the school lunch and
breakfast programs continue to supporting the health of school children. The Department’s
recommendations on sodium reduction and consumption of whole grains, in particular, are
consistent with our own commitments and contribute to broader sodium reduction in American 
2
diets. We believe these revised standards will have a meaningful impact on student health and justify
continued public and private efforts to further the development of lower-sodium and whole grainrich products.
In its Interim Final Rule, USDA proposes to allow State agencies to continue granting exemptions
to complying with the whole grain-rich requirement and retains the Sodium Target 1 as the
regulatory limit in the National School Lunch Program (NSLP) and School Breakfast Program (SBP)
through the end of SY 2020–2021, stating that this will “allow food industry more time for product
development and reformulation.” Having these standards thwarted is a great disappointment and
not only has economic consequences to the food industry, but also blunts our nation’s ability to
address its nutritional health needs.
We urge USDA to move forward with implementation of sodium reduction and whole grainrich requirements in school meal programs as there is no longer any need for whole grain
waivers. Our collective commitment to developing a range of whole grain products and lower
sodium options demonstrates industry’s ability to be a productive partner in addressing crucial
public health problems. We hope that USDA will consider us as resource as it finalizes this rule.",In favor of original HHFKA

Hunger and food insecurity affect far too many Americans. In New York State, the overall food
insecurity rate in New York is at 12.5%,
1 and an estimated 19.4%2 of children live in food
insecure households. The number of households receiving SNAP benefits has remained
relatively consistent over the past three years, providing evidence that the economic recovery
has reached the lowest-income New Yorkers much more slowly than it has others. In October
2017, the most recent month for which data is available, 2,833,407 residents received SNAP
benefits,3 and estimated 38%4 of whom are children.
The new USDA nutrition standards for school meals are extraordinarily important for the health
and academic success of New York’s school children. In families of all incomes, more than 1.4
million of the state’s 2.7 million K-12 public school students ate lunch at school each day in
FY2016; more than 1 million of them were low-income children whose families were struggling
to make ends meet. Nearly 567,000 children (484,000 of them low-income) ate school
breakfast every day. 5
The healthier school meal rules have been an important step for our nation to remedy
nutritional shortfalls in children’s diets and to help address the current high rates of obesity and
chronic disease. We want the best nutrition for all children, particularly low income children
who may lack access to consistent healthy, quality food outside of school. Research shows that
the new standards have a positive impact on the school nutrition environment as well as
student food selection and consumption, especially for fruits and vegetables.
We are concerned about the proposed changes to the school nutrition standards, and strongly
support maintaining the current, evidence-based school meal program standards to assure that
all children have access to foods that support their health, wellbeing, and learning, irrespective
of the school they attend.
School meals should be consistent with the Dietary Guidelines for Americans, including serving
whole-grain foods and limiting sodium and saturated fat. This is especially important because
most American children do not consume enough fiber and whole grains, and consume too
much sodium and fat. The majority of schools are fully and successfully meeting the current
nutrition requirements already; this is not a time for rolling back the standards. The nutrition
quality improvements, when fully implemented, will ensure that all food served in schools
supports positive health and education outcomes for all children. While a variety of factors
influence participation in the school lunch program, strong participation among all categories of
students—free, reduced-price, and paid— makes for stronger programs overall. While
significant improvements in school meals programs have made them increasingly accessible to
low income families, the factors leading to declines in participation among paid students are
multiple and can be countered in a practical manner. We agree with USDA that the goal of safeguarding nutrition standard integrity in all the child
nutrition programs is important. Maintaining integrity is best served by a balanced effective
approach that employs mechanisms to preserve integrity and access to the programs.
Recommendations
To ensure that children get the full value from the new healthier school meals, we offer these
recommendations to increase the reach of the school nutrition programs:
• ensure that students who are eligible for free and reduced-price school meals are
certified by working with states to improve and strengthen direct certification systems, and
address any barriers in the school meal application process;
• encourage schools to offer free breakfast and lunch to all students through the
Community Eligibility Provision, and any other federal provisions that are available to schools;
and
• promote breakfast in the classroom and other alternative school breakfast models.
We encourage USDA to continue its excellent nutrition education (e.g., Team Nutrition),
program technical assistance, training, and education initiatives.
In summary, we are concerned about proposed revisions to the school meal standards. Our
nation’s children need and deserve strong, evidence-based nutrition standards that support
their learning, health, and well-being.

to express grave concerns regarding the proposed changes to the school nutrition standards, which
deviate from scientific evidence on optimal childhood nutrition. We strongly support maintaining the
current, evidence-based standards for the National School Lunch and School Breakfast Programs to
ensure that all children have access to foods that support their health, well-being, and learning. There is
an extensive body of literature on the benefits of child nutrition programs for the health, development,
and food security of children.1,2,3
Studies show federal school meals programs are associated with
improved dietary intake and food security for school-aged children.4,5
Brain function is sensitive to the quality and quantity of foods consumed throughout one’s lifespan,
including the elementary and secondary school years. The brain requires high energy consumption from
low-calorie nutrient dense foods. Therefore, school-age children who experience undernutrition cannot
learn as much, as fast, or as well, and consequently do more poorly in school and have lower academic
achievement.6
So school meals provide the nutrition for optimizing brain function.
We are particularly concerned by the precedents set to date by the so-called “flexibilities” granted
school food authorities that encourage them to violate evidence-based recommendations regarding
whole-grain rich requirements, sodium limits, and low-fat flavored milk.
7 These exemptions are clearly
not consistent with extant scientific evidence, and not in the best interests of children’s health.
We urge the USDA to continue to use the most current science available to inform your next course of
action with respect to the nutrition standards. Changing school meal standards so that they are
inconsistent with the USDA’s Dietary Guidelines for Americans will not only harm our nation’s school
children, but set a harmful precedent of deviating from evidence-based policies that promote health.

Healthier school meal rules have been an important step for our nation to improve nutritional shortfalls in childrens diets and to help address the current high rates of obesity and chronic disease. Good nutrition for all children, particularly low income children who may lack access to consistent healthy, quality food outside of school is so important. As a School Nutrition Director, I have personally seen our students' acceptance and consumption of a broader variety of foods increase over the past five years. 
The USDA nutrition standards for school meals are important for the health and academic success of Americas school children. Thirty million children
eat lunch at school every day; more than 21 million of them are low-income children
whose families are struggling to make ends meet. Nearly 15 million children (12 million of them low-income) eat school breakfast every day.

I support maintaining the current, evidence-based school meal program standards to assure that all children have access to foods that support their health, well being, and learning, irrespective of the school they attend. This generation of school children becoming healthier adults could potentially result in a major improvement on the future of nation's healthcare.

(HHFKA) of 2010 which ushered in improved school meal nutrition standards.
• Kids eating more fruits and vegetables because of the improved HHFKA nutrition standards.
• Increased school lunch revenue. Nationwide, schools saw a net increase in revenue from school
lunches of approximately $200 million.
• Healthy food standards did not increase food waste. While plate waste is always concerning,
the amount of waste was not increased since before the meal pattern changed.
• Participation increased substantially in many areas of the country. California's largest school
district, Los Angeles Unified, saw a 14 percent increase in participation with the HHFKA meal
standards.
• Virtually all schools continued to offer the federal school meal programs. Despite media

15 million children (12 million of them low-income) eat school breakfast every day.

cafeteria staff to produce meals from scratch that meet the improved standards, maintain
labor costs, and decrease plate waste. We know firsthand it is possible to meet or exceed
the new nutrition standards while producing delicious, kid-friendly meals.
A series of plate waste studies conducted by Dr. Julia Cohen at the Harvard School of
Public Health found that students in schools with the CIS intervention had a 72%

We are sympathetic to the challenges of school nutrition professionals and know that it takes effort, time, and
ingenuity to change children’s eating habits, but it can be done.
In June 2017, the USDA reported over 90 percent of schools successfully met the updated nutrition standards, with
reports of increased participation and revenue. Preserving the existing timeline for reductions in sodium, requiring
whole grains, and maintaining the requirement of non-fat milk continues to motivate remaining schools to innovate.
The USDA and organizations like Project Bread play a crucial role in helping school food authorities to succeed in
providing the healthiest possible meals. The proposed interim rule refers to the challenges of local operators;
however rolling back sends the wrong message. Nutrition professionals need and deserve more support. However
they do not need flexibilities that come at the expense of our children.
 This is not the time for rolling back the standards at the expense of these children.
The flexibilities proposed by this rule could increase:
? Obesity: Intake of whole-grain products promotes satiety more quickly than refined grains due to their
high fiber content. Eating refined grains may cause overconsumption of calories contributing to weight
gain and obesity.
? Diabetes: Increased intake of refined grains means increased intake of simple sugars, which increase blood
sugar and insulin resistance, resulting in increased risk for diabetes.
? Heart Disease: High sodium intake is associated with high blood pressure in children and teenagers, with
effects greater in those who are overweight or obese. In addition, 1% flavored milk is higher in calories,
cholesterol, and total fat than fat-free flavored milk.
We urge you to maintain the enhanced nutrition standards and provide support to school nutrition professionals in
order to achieve the existing targets. The opportunity to improve health for children is too great and the cost of
weakening nutrition standards is too high.

than following the 2010 Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act that improved nutrition
standards for school meals.
The 2010 decision to adopt higher nutrition standards reflected years of research
presented in reports by a wide range of health and nutrition experts and institutions,
including the Harvard University T.H. Chan School of Public Health, the 2015-2020
Dietary Guidelines for Americans (DGA), the National Academies of Science,
Engineering, and Medicine and the 2009 report School Meals: Building Blocks for
Healthy Children.
We believe the new rule is harmful in the following ways:
1. Kids already have too much sodium in their diet (""Sodium Intake among US
School-Aged Children: National Health Nutrition Examination Survey, 2011-
2012”), and freezing sodium at 2014 levels in school meals will not continue the
progress of getting sodium amounts under control and to a healthy level for our
kids. Too much sodium in a diet can lead to high blood pressure and
cardiovascular disease later in life.
2. As of October 2016, 99% of all schools have implemented the new standards according to the Food Research and Action 
Center, so why do we need waivers for food that contains less than 51% whole grain? This standard is already being met.
Furthermore, whole grain is healthy and important in the diet of our young learners. Whole grains contain increased
vitamins, minerals, and fiber as compared to refined grains. USDA’s MyPlate suggests that Americans make half of our
grains whole. Ensuring that students receive whole grains in the school setting helps make it easier for children to meet
this goal.
3. School districts are now free to use 1% flavored milk in addition to the previously permitted skim or 1% plain
milk & skim flavored milk. While schools are not required to provide the sweetened milk, most do, and the
inclusion of sweetened milk has menu planning repercussions beyond the milk itself. When higher caloric
sweetened milk options are provided all students at the school may get less food because some students get
significantly more calories from their milk choice. A student choosing 1% chocolate milk is getting an
additional 60 kcal and 12g of added sugar as compared to the student who chooses skim milk. Based on the
way that caloric intake is analyzed for USDA compliance to NSLP requirements, this means that a school
serving 1% flavored milk must balance the calories within the highest caloric milk against the calories provided
within the food, which could shortchange some students real nutrition because of the extra calories being
served through the sugar-sweetened flavored milk. A school not serving sweetened milk must provide their
students the same number of weekly calories as a school that does. Therefore, the plain-milk-only school must
provide a wider variety of food options lest they fall short of caloric minimums.
Finally, according to the Food Research and Action Center, more students participated on an average day in the free lunch program
the year after new nutrition standards were implemented (2013-14) than the year before. In fact, in 2013-14, more students
received free lunches on an average day than any year previously in at least the ten years prior.
We strongly recommend that you abandon the interim final rule “Child Nutrition Programs: Flexibilities for Milk, Whole Grains,
and Sodium Requirements” (IFR) (82 FR 56703), and instead follow the school nutrition guidance of the Healthy, Hunger-Free
Kids Act for the reasons outlined above.",In favor of original HHFKA
2017,FNS-2017-0021-7676,nan,Other government agency - (non school),"The Santa Clara Public Health Department is writing to comment on the delay and roll-back of
implementing certain nutrition regulations for the National School Lunch and School Breakfast
Programs. We strongly oppose the United States Department of Agriculture's (USDA's) allowance for
low-fat flavored milk in schools, delay of sodium reduction in school meals, and exemptions for
schools to serve refined grains as part of reimbursable meals. We recommend the following actions:
• Do not allow schools to serve low-fat flavored milk through 2019. Reinstate the regulation
that schools can only serve non-fat flavored milk; and
• Continue with the original implementation timeline for sodium reduction; and
• Do not allow exemptions for schools to include grain products that are less than 50 percent
whole grain as part of a reimbursable meal through 2019. Reinstate the regulation that schools
must serve whole-grain-rich products as part of a reimbursable meal.
According to the USDA, 8 percent of U.S. households with children were food insecure in 2016.i This
means that 3.1 million households including children were occasionally or frequently unable to obtain
enough food to meet the needs of their household members. ii These numbers demonstrate the
important role school meals can play in a child's diet, and thus overall health and well-being.
In Santa Clara County, over 37 percent of students are eligible to receive free or reduced-price school
meals. iii This means schools play an important role in ensuring the highest nutritional quality of what
these students consume, as most U.S. children receive more than half of their daily caloric intake from
school meals. iv Providing healthful school meals has positive effects on both students and the schools
they attend.
Research has shown that food insecurity can increase risk for reduced dietary quality and undernutrition in affected households.v This puts students from food insecure households at increased risk for hindered cognitive development and school performance. vi Food insecurity and poor diet can also
put children at increased risk for asthma, anemia, multiple cancers, and for becoming overweight or
obese.vii,viii
On the other hand, maintaining strict nutritional standards in schools can help to reduce nutritional
disparities, granting students in need greater access to nutritious foods. This is important considering
that higher nutritional quality of meals, not quantity of calories consumed, is associated with improved
test scores. ix Additionally, improved nutrition standards have positive impacts on middle school and
high school attendance, and stricter USDA school meal nutrition standards have been positively
received by middle school and high school students and their parents.x,xi
Approximately 99 percent of school districts have already successfully implemented the USDA's
school nutrition standards as of October 2016.xii Those opposing implementation of the new USDA
nutrition standards cite declining participation in school lunch due to students disliking the new,
healthier foods. However, participation in school lunch in moderate and higher income children has
continuously decreased before implementation ofthe stricter USDA school nutrition standards. This
decline is partially driven by the fact that many children shifted from paying for school lunch to
receiving them at free or reduced prices due to decreasing family incomes during the most recent
recession. xiii
The final rule published by the USDA in 2012 was designed to increase the healthfulness of meals
served to children through the National School Lunch and School Breakfast Programs (NSLP and
SBP). The original regulations are based on the latest scientific evidence and nutritional guidelines,
and they allow for considerable time and flexibility for schools to implement the regulations. As stated
previously, nearly all schools are compliant with them as originally written. Schools and manufacturers do not need additional time to uphold the rules, and rolling back certain provisions only serves to
reduce the healthfulness of meals served to our nation's children.
Allowing schools to serve low-fat flavored milk will only decrease the overall healthfulness of meals
offered as part of the NSLP and SBP. A single serving oflow-fat flavored milk contains about 50-60
more calories than non-fat flavored milk. While this may not seem like very many calories, these
calories could be better spent offering more nutrient-dense fruits and vegetables as part of a
reimbursable meal.
School-aged children are consuming too much sodium, with 9 out of every 10 children exceeding
daily recommended sodium limits.xiv Reducing sodium intake can lead to lower cardiovascular disease
and death rates.xv Continuing with the original sodium reduction targets will improve the health of
children and teenagers by reducing their sodium consumption. The sodium targets also encourage
schools to include fewer unhealthy, processed foods and more freshly-prepared, healthy foods as part
of their reimbursable meals. Lastly, the original rules require schools to serve whole grain products that contain at least 50 percent
whole grains. Whole grains contain necessary vitamins and nutrients, such as fiber, whereas refined
grains have little to no nutritional value. Considering that most children in the US eat as much as half
their calories at school,xvi allowing schools to serve non-whole-grain products will reduce the overall
quality of children's diets.
Santa Clara County has long supported policy, systems, and environmental strategies, such as nutrition
standards for school meals, to support the health of our children. We believe that students have the
right to access nutritious foods during the school day, which is why we believe it is vital for the USDA
to maintain strict nutrition standards for school meals. For those who rely on school meals as their
main source of food, ensuring the utmost nutritional quality is critical. The USDA must reject this
delayed implementation and roll-back of the school meal nutrition standards in order to uphold the
Food and Nutrition Service's strategic priority to ""provide Americans with access to nutritious
foods.""xvii Maintaining the highest possible nutrition standards for school meals will benefit all of our
nation's students, especially our most vulnerable students, schools, and communities.

We, City Harvest, respectfully submit comments in response to the U.S. Department of Agricultures (USDA) Child Nutrition Programs: Flexibilities for Milk, Whole Grains, and Sodium Requirements interim final rule (IFR) (82 FR 56703), and oppose weakening school nutrition standards.
David DeVaughn
Director, Policy & Community Engagement
City Harvest, a member of Feeding America
We, City Harvest, respectfully submit comments in response to the U.S. Department of Agriculture's
(USDA) ""Child Nutrition Programs: Flexibilities for Milk, Whole Grains, and Sodium Requirements""
interim final rule (IFR) (82 FR 56703), and oppose weakening school nutrition standards. Virtually all
schools (99 percent) participating in the National School Lunch and Breakfast Programs are making
great progress toward serving healthier meals for low-income children with less sodium; more
whole grains, fruits, and vegetables; and no trans fat; and removing sugary drinks and unhealthy
snack food. 1 The 2012 updates to school nutrition standards reflect sound science, support
children's health, and are consistent with the 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans (DGA)2 and
the National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine (formerly, Institute of Medicine) 2009
report School Meals: Building Blocks for Healthy Children.3
City Harvest pioneered food rescue in 1982 and, this year, will collect 59 million pounds of excess
food to help feed the nearly 1.3 million New Yorkers struggling to put meals on their tables.
Through relationships with farms, grocers, restaurants, and manufacturers, City Harvest collects
nutritious food that would otherwise go to waste and delivers it free of charge to 500 soup kitchens,
food pantries and other community food programs across the five boroughs. In addition, our
Healthy Neighborhoods initiative addresses long term food insecurity through community
partnerships, including with schools that work to increase access to affordable and wholesome food.
Since spring 2014, we have co-convened the New York City Alliance for Child Nutrition
Reauthorization (NYC4CNR), a diverse group of stakeholders working together to advocate for
changes to the next Child Nutrition Reauthorization Act. We believe that a strong CNR will
strengthen local economies and communities by ensuring children are free from hunger, wellnourished, and ready to learn. Given the last reauthorization ofthe Child Nutrition Act legislated
cuts to SNAP, which negatively impacted millions of Americans, we believe no future legislation
should include cuts to critical anti-hunger programs.
The Harvard University T.H. Chan School of Public Health concluded that the update to school
nutrition standards is ""one of the most important national obesity prevention policy achievements in
recent decades.""4 Researchers estimate that these improvements prevent more than 2 million cases of childhood obesity and save up to $792 million in health-care related costs over ten years.
Improved school nutrition is critical given that one out of three children and adolescents aged 2 to
19 years is overweight or obese5•6 and children consume one-third to one-half of daily calories
during the school day.7 Contrary to supporting schools and children's health, the proposed changes
in the IFR could jeopardize this progress.
The three-year delay in the second sodium reduction levels would harm children's health
We oppose the proposed three-year delay (from School Year 2017-2018 to School Year 2021 -2022)
of the second sodium reduction targets (Target 2) for school meals that would lock in unsafe levels
of sodium for children. Unfortunately, nine out of ten children consume too much sodium,8
increasing their risk of high blood pressure, heart disease, and stroke.9 Many schools, food service
companies, and others in industry are working toward or already providing healthy and appealing
meals and products with less sodium. USDA should address remaining challenges through training
and technical assistance. Delaying the second phase of sodium reduction puts children's health at
risk and would result in children consuming an extra 84 to 98 teaspoons of salt (over the course of
the three-year delay).10 Further, we are opposed to any delay of the third and final phase of sodium
reduction for school meals (Target 3 which is supposed to go into effect School Year 2022-2023).
Continuing the whole-grains waiver is unnecessary
There is no need to continue the whole-grain waivers. USDA concedes in the IFR that 85 percent of
schools have not requested waivers and are providing children with appealing whole-grain options.
If all schools in Alabama, Idaho, and Montana can serve whole grains to their students, schools in
the rest ofthe states should be able to as well.11 Eating more whole grains is associated with
reduced risk of heart disease, stroke, and diabetes, provides more nutrients, and are a healthful
source offiber.12 Children, on average, consume too few whole grains and too many refined
grains.13
Allowing flavored low-fat milk is inconsistent with expert dietary advice and school needs
We oppose allowing flavored low-fat (1 percent) milk for school meals and as a competitive food.
The current standards that allow plain or flavored fat-free milk and plain low-fat milk are based on
expert recommendations from the National Academy of Medicine's 2009 report. 14 The recommendations disallowed flavored low-fat milk because it would provide more calories and likely
exceed the calorie maximum for school meals. The 2015 DGA similarly recommended, ""increasing
the proportion of dairy intake that is fat-free or low-fat milk"" and ""reducing the intake of added
sugars"" such as those in flavored milk. 15 Similarly, the Robert Wood johnson Foundation's Healthier
Beverage Guidelines recommend only plain fat-free and low-fat milk for children and adolescents.16
Further, the Robert Wood johnson Foundation panel recommended that if schools offered flavored
low-fat milk, it should be no more than 130 calories per 8 ounces. If USDA allows flavored low-fat
milk, we recommend a calorie cap of no more than 130 calories per 8 ounces, consistent with the
Robert Wood johnson Foundation's Healthier Beverage Guidelines.
Conclusion
We oppose further delay of the sodium reduction targets (both Target 2 and Target 3), the
continuation of the whole-grains waiver, and allowing flavored low-fat milk. Rather than weakening
school nutrition standards, we urge the administration to support efforts to continue the progress
to improve school food.

2017,FNS-2017-0021-7687,nan,Advocacy,"Hello, my name is Hether Frayer. I facilitate a group called Healthy Foods in Schools for Kalamazoo County in southwest Michigan. Our group fully agrees with the words of Howell Wechsler, the Chief Executive Officer of Alliance for a Healthier Generation on this issue:
""The changes proposed by the Flexibility Rule do not reflect the tremendous progress and success we have seen from schools across the country in meeting or exceeding national guidelines for healthier school meals. 
Healthier Generations Healthy Schools Program has worked with schools to implement healthier meals that meet federal nutrition standards required by the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010, which were derived from the best scientific evidence of our childrens dietary needs. The success weve witnessed at the school level demonstrates that schools can serve nutritious and appealing meals while meeting the original timeline for meal pattern requirements. This success runs contrary to U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdues recent statement that schools need flexibility in menu planning so they can serve nutritious and appealing meals. Tens of thousands of schools are already doing just that  serving up nutritious and delicious meals.
Additionally, the data does not support the need for additional flexibility. The USDAs 2016 press release indicated that 99 percent of schools nationwide reported meeting the existing nutrition standards. Further, the former Kids Safe and Healthful Foods Project of The Pew Charitable Trusts found that near the end of the 2014-15 school year, 6 in 10 directors said they faced few or no ongoing obstacles to meeting updated school breakfast requirements. We have seen this data come to life through meals planned and served by schools across the country.    
Every child deserves a healthy future  now is not the time to reverse progress toward that reality. Instead of lowering standards, we need to provide additional training and resources to the minority of schools that have difficulty meeting sodium targets and whole grain requirements. Schools need our support to continue offering meals that keep kids healthy, an investment in our childrens health that will best prepare the next generation for success.""
Let's move forward in supporting healthy kids.

I am 28 and grew up in the public school system. I'm just now learning how to feed myself for health. This is something I've had to relearn and take up as an adult when it should have been taught from a young age. The things we had to eat at my school (which was in a pretty well off area, for perspective) were nachos made of only chips and melted cheese, burgers, pizza hut, chick fil a, and various white starchy foods... any vegetables were canned or visibly spoiled and fruit was prepackaged in sugar. Drinks included several types of milk, soda, and juice from concentrate/highly sugared... water, unsweetened tea, or fresh juice were unheard of. If this unhealthy lunch did not satisfy you, there were always vending machines. We were not allowed to order lunch nor leave for lunch. If you brought your lunch there were no refrigerators in which to keep it and lockers were not large enough for insulated lunch bags. This should not be a teenager's lunch much less a lunch encouraged by official policy. 
My brother is 10 years younger than me and recently graduated from the same school. He has explained to me that not much has changed. The lunch options have only slightly better vegetables, only two or so kinds of fresh fruit, and the vending machines have a few healthier options (but healthIER does not mean *healthy*). Though the increase of whole grains has been made clear and are inconsequential to most students.
Americans designated as 'millennials' and younger are the first that are not expected to live longer or healthier lives than their parents' generation and that is certainly NOT because we've reached the apex of health in our nation. I understand that student choice has some input on lunch policy and is often pointed to as the reason why healthier options in schools should not be encouraged much less become/stay the official policy. However, this is a 'red herring'. Much more influential are the industries that market to teenagers and those The Agricultural Act of 2014 subsidize. 
I'm begging the USDA to not only refrain from rolling back recent health mandates but to increase their stringency and continue to improve student meals. Such policies can only lead to a better informed and healthier adult population - which in turn creates benefits in other policy areas as well (such as economic and health policy).

I've noted that the menu offers more salads, more fruits and vegetables, more high protein, less sodium, etc., than when I was growing up.  I noticed the children eating healthier choices on their own!  At home, grandson, Noah (age 11), will often choose an apple over taco chips or potato chips!  Given choices of cereals, he usually opts for raisin bran or multi-grain cereals with nuts and fruits in it.  He loves his smoothies made of fresh fruits and yogurt rather than any soda or juice ""product"" offered.  I always give the kids a choice; do not believe that eating cake or brownies will ruin them, but I am constantly delighted that they usually hit the fruits first.  My granddaughters (ages 9 and 10) eat tomatoes off the vine, grow their own vegetables, and love salads.    The school menu helps them make good choices for their health and their future.

Sugar has been proven over and over  to be bad for one's health especially for ones teeth. The flavor in these drinks is not real fruit syrup, but some dangerous chemical concoction developed by the food industry. It is also accepted by ALL reputable nutritionists that whole grain flour is more nutritious than white flour. Lastly, the the salt industry pushes the use of salt to extremes in soups and many other products instead of using more expensive and nutritious taste enhancers.  Excess salt  is also a cause of high blood pressure and other maladies. So,your sensible changes will not provide a more nutritious meal for the students, but only line the pockets of the salt, chemical and non-nutritious wheat industry. ",In favor of original HHFKA

2017,FNS-2017-0021-0504,nan,Constituent,"These meals that children get at school might possibly be their main meal of the day which is of the utmost importance for their health. I know about hunger and going without food myself often as a child, and I can tell you that even one meal a day can keep you healthy enough to get by, although it still is not enough to raise a child optimally. Nutrition is more important than ever with obesity rates booming and while children are developing physically and mentally. Children need healthy nutrition for their developing brains and growing bodies. Children that dont have enough nutrition can develop slower cognitively and physically. Children especially need milk for their bones but they also need milk that is higher in fat content when they are younger. Shrinking the fat content can actually deny children of important fat that they need for growth during the first years of their lives. This has been proven to be true for babies especially. Later, when children reach adolescence they require less milk and milk fats and when they reach adulthood milk should actually be avoided. This is because milk turns into glucose and therefore a sugar which ages the body. These are the latest health facts to date on milk. So high fat milk is important early in childhood, low-fat milk is more desired in adolescence, and an avoidance of milk and alternate form of calcium is optimal in adulthood.
     Bleached flour takes the important nutrition out of the wheat by bleaching and the person eating this junk food will be less healthy for the simple reason this white color is more attractive than whole wheat flour. I personally always try to buy I bleached flour for that reason of not wanting to eat empty calories. Children need more calories while they are growing because they expend so much more energy than adults and they are developing their bodies which build on whatever they consume. If schools provide optimal levels of nutrition then the children will have optimal levels growth both physically and mentally. It has also been proven that people that eat nutritional meals have better behavior towards others because they are more able to think about others in a more conscientious manner. School nutrition is a win win situation where children are happier because they are not thinking about food while satiated, they develop better mentally and physically and make for more conscientious adults. Also, when given nutritious foods over junk foods children learn about healthy foods and develop a taste for healthier foods. Junk foods are still also eaten by children and adults and schools cannot monitor children when they are not at school but given good wholesome foods school at least provides a daily buffer against non nutritious foods.",In favor of original HHFKA

Thanks to today's barely-there incomes, families struggle to provide enough food, quality food for their children. Schools around the country are all too aware of this situation, and understand the need for children to have access to quality, nutritious food if they are to succeed in life. Too many families are unable to provide the basics for their children, and must rely on these programs to help provide what they cannot.

My children eat breakfast and lunch at their respective schools. They may not always enjoy the foods, but that has more to do with schools essentially reheating frozen tasteless meals, but I know I can count on my children at least receiving the nutrients they need throughout the day. While I may be able to understand using enriched grains over whole-wheat as they are generally cheaper there is not the same justification for flavored milk, 1% milk and extra salt in foods. Are we so lazy that we cannot think of ways to make foods enjoyable AND nutritious? Are we so blas about obesity in this country that the government feels this is not a priority? Is the science so weak, or has no one bothered to read it, that the government does not understand the magnitude of early intervention of proper nutrition? I choose not to believe that my own government could be so ignorant and unfeeling. I choose to believe that you will do what is right for our nation's children. Why I am sure they would like ketchup to be a vegetable and greasy, salty comfort foods at every meal, I am equally as sure that both elected and appointed officials understand that as adults, we have to do what is best which is not always the same as what is wanted.

Please do not make this change; many children living in poverty rely on publicly funded meals at school to help address their nutritional needs, deficiencies and day to day hunger.  Whole grain foods naturally provide more nutrients and fiber than refined foods.  Micronutrients are important for all of us but especially for growing children.  Fiber is important as it has inherent health benefits but also helps people feel satisfied for longer, which can help reduce overeating if nutrient poor foods.  Fiber helps slow the release of sugars into the bloodstream which helps reduce insulin resistance.
Many children dont have a support structure that teaches them about healthy eating; like anything else, the way we eat is habitual.  We must model healthier food choices so children will incorporate good habits. 
I also want to urge that children should be encouraged to avoid unnecessary sugars, including in milk which ch is already high in natural sugar.

One could make the argument that kids won't eat the healthy foods and starve, because they usually don't look tasty, but if a good health/nutrition education program was provided by schools within all the grade levels, starting even in the elementary level, and involving the parents in it, maybe the population of the USA would have a greater knowledge about it, and kids would be more influenced to eat healthy foods.

2017,FNS-2017-0021-0951,nan,Constituent,"We already know that we have an epidemic of obesity among children and the Dept of Agriculture undertook to redefine nutritional standards for children, placing healthier foods in school lunch rooms. But just knowing about obesity among children does not always indicate the reasons for this issue in the population.
However, looking at the food security of our nation's school attending children can be instructive. Parents who cannot regularly provide enough food for their family are found within low income groups, working minimum wage jobs, because that is all that is available, and working lengthy hours in two or more jobs, just to provide for the family's survival needs.
Often enough parents have to decide what need gets met - food, housing, clothing, medications, anything that is just basic. Sometimes sufficient food is unavailable to family members. That can be when families rely upon less nutritional foods, like ramen noodles, pizza, hamburgers and fries, so family members can have full stomachs and not have to deal with the pain caused by an empty or partially empty stomach. 
Thus the need for school meals to provide what is missing at home. In these food insecure families, getting nutritional meals at school is frequently the only way children can get this type of food. And balanced diets help children's immune systems, so they don't succumb frequently to illness and they can participate fully in learning activities. 
Since Congress is planning to decrease SNAP funding, it's even more imperative for nutritional meals to be served in schools. If this is neglected, children may end up starving, with all of the implications for hunger and starvation reducing the ability to learn. Less healthy children means a less healthy nation. Skilled jobs won't be filled, more funding will be needed to refeed these starving children. It becomes a huge expense that could have been avoided by providing nutritional school meals.

More importantly, our industry partners have done a great job of providing us with wonderful whole grain rich products and products that meet key sodium guidelines. By continuing to offer this so called flexibility all you are doing is taking away the incentive for those companies to continue to develop high quality and healthy products. The reality is that the rule only requires things to be WHOLE GRAIN RICH so the products we are serving our kids already are not as healthy as they could be if they were 100% whole grain. We were able to find every single form of whole grain rich bread item we needed easily and they tasted delicious.Finally, it is no secrete that our country is facing an epidemic of poor health and fitness. Much of which is directly related to increasingly easy access to poor quality foods. There is an entire industry out there created to help people unlearn bad eating habits in an effort to stay healthy. I view the HHFKA as a chance to raise a generation of kids who enjoy eating healthfully. If they see brown bread, vegetables, and healthy fruits in schools every single day research shows us that they will ask for these foods at home. Why do we want to limit the opportunity to give these students a chance to grow up with a healthy mindset? Wouldn't it be great to see students be able to focus on innovation and creation in their field of interested rather than needing to dedicated their adult life to unlearning bad eating habits and trying to find a path to healthfulness? 
School lunch programs do not need flexibility in nutrition requirements.

NO! As the educated adults, we need to educate the children about healthier choices and follow up our words with action-healthy food on their plates.
Cutting back regulations, that I argue aren't strong enough, is not the answer!
The more children are exposed to whole grains, the more accustomed they will become to them and the more they will eat and enjoy.  
And by offering whole grains at school, children might bring home that preference and inspire other family members.

I also have children in public school who enjoy the school lunch program and snacks that meet the USDA standards.   I also volunteer for our school wellness committee. I am committed to improving the health and wellness of others, preventing diseases such as diabetes and helping others make healthy food choices.  
I understand the difficult balance between providing healthy balanced meals, increasing utilization of school lunch, reducing food waste and keeping the costs down.  I also understand that many healthy foods are inexpensive such as legumes, rice, potatoes, peanut butter, whole wheat breads, corn, tomatoes products, raisins and apples.  Teaching children to enjoy combinations of budget-friendly healthy minimally processed foods would help them enjoy these foods at home also.  Developing tastes for and learning how to put together healthy inexpensive foods would be especially helpful for financially challenged families.
My concern is that the previous standards for fiber and whole grains were too weak.  I worry that the USDA suggested policy changes would make the school lunch program less healthy.  One hundred percent whole grain products provide more fiber, may improve satiety yet don't take away from the flavor of the foods.  The modified formulations food manufacturers are using to meet USDA standards for schools such as reducing the sugar, increasing the whole grains and lowering the sodium in cereals, crackers, snack bars and baked goods are a step in the right direction, but do not teach children how to eat minimally processed inexpensive foods.  In addition, the healthier formulations are not found at the stores, so if the children develop a love for a particular brand of marshmallow cereal at school, the one they beg their parents to buy at the store will be expensive and less healthy.  The parents may erroneously assume that if it's offered in school, it must be healthy.
Even though the cost is low and the acceptance is high, feeding children processed and high sugary breakfasts such as donuts, juice and chocolate milk for breakfast impairs the development of healthy food habits.  These food combinations with highly processed grains, low fiber and added sugar are not a good example for a breakfast for managing weight, preventing diabetes, cancer and heart disease.  After professionally helping adults with chronic conditions learn to undo the food habits that exacerbate their chronic conditions, I'm dismayed to see children developing these unhealthy preferences as part of the school food service.
I encourage the USDA to continue to promote that growing children have the calories they need for satiety, for promoting optimal growth and learning during the school day.  But, I also encourage the USDA to fully consider the educational opportunity for developing healthy lifestyles regarding food choices.  The cafeteria food options at schools should look less like a mini-mart/convenience store and more like the Choosemyplate healthy plate.  The healthy plate model can be affordable and tasty with minimally processed grains such as whole wheat rolls, 100% woven wheat crackers, corn tortillas, oats and brown rice.  The healthy plate model is excellent at balancing the nutrients with vegetables, a protein, a fruit, healthy oils and a low-fat dairy.  The USDA school food program can help children develop food preferences and healthy food habits that promote optimal health and disease prevention in a budget-friendly way.   Please reconsider liberalizing the whole grain requirements at this time and instead shift focus to making it easier for districts to provide 100% whole grains to their students.

2017,FNS-2017-0021-1061,nan,Constituent,"Introduction: The USDA provides evidence-based guidelines for healthy nutrition standards that should be maintained for the health of our youth. With obesity rates at an all-time high, it is imperative that we support robust nutritional standards nation-wide. This is particularly important for the school breakfast and lunch programs not only because it is an opportunity to reinforce healthy eating habits but also because for some children, it is the only place they are receiving meals. According to the CDC, most children in the US “consume as much as half of their daily calories at school” (“School Nutrition Environment | Healthy Schools | CDC,” 2017).  Schools are in a unique position to improve eating behaviors and influence preferences of children and must take on the responsibility of this guiding role.  The availability of healthy and nutritious meals is critical for children’s learning, establishing the foundation for the best success in the classroom each day. According to the CDC, “eating a healthy breakfast is associated with improved cognitive function (especially memory), reduced absenteeism, and improved mood” (“Good Food At The Heart Of Healthy Kids,” n.d.). The USDA must uphold the recommended nutritional guidelines as they stand without flexibility to ensure children are consuming the healthiest meal options possible. Early and repeated consumption of these healthy choices will assist in establishing better eating habits and expand preferences to more healthful foods.  
 
Factors for Consideration:  • Community Food Preferences: Children form healthy eating behaviors when nutritious options are introduced to them. Beginning these behaviors at younger ages is particularly important because children’s palates are still developing. Having healthy meal options that are compliant with national guidelines in school breakfast and lunch programs, healthy behaviors and preferences can be created and reinforced. This interim final rule provides flexibilities with the intent is to “assist Program operators with specific challenges that limit their ability to offer nutritious and appealing meals that reflect community preferences, and that students enjoy and consume” however, it is critical that these program operators be the stewards in establishing appealing options and healthy preferences in our youth. Since healthy eating behaviors are shaped at a young age and children spend on average 6 or more hours in school 5 days a week, it is imperative that schools continue to be the leader in reinforcing nutritious eating and shaping preferences while children’s palates are developing (Birch et al., 2007).  
 
• Product Development Flexibilities: When this rule was originally drafted in 2012 the USDA received comments advising, “that food providers need time for product development and testing, and schools need time for procurement changes, menu development, sampling, and fostering student acceptance,” (“Regulations.gov - Child Nutrition Programs: Flexibilities for Milk, Whole Grains, and Sodium Requirements,” n.d.)  It should not take school districts and food providers more than 5 years to implement these healthy food changes. The Partnership 
for a Healthier America’s Hospital Healthier Food Initiative for example, has an adoption timeline of four years from start to finish, which includes nutrition standard compliance, menu labeling and food preparation improvements (“Hospital Healthier Food Initiative,” n.d.). If hospitals and health systems can transform their food system in less than 4 years, so too, should the school districts be able to.   
 
The rule’s language highlights that since the rule was introduced, “the availability of whole grain-rich products through USDA Foods and the commercial market has increased significantly since the implementation of the meal standards and continues to progress, providing new and affordable options for local operators to integrate into menus,” (“Regulations.gov - Child Nutrition Programs: Flexibilities for Milk, Whole Grains, and Sodium Requirements,” n.d.). Considering this information, the USDA should recognize the increasing variety for more healthful options for menu development, and maintain their originally proposed nutritional standards. Further, the rule’s commentary states that School Food Authorities are finding, that due to the expanded market of compliant food options, it has become easier to meet the nutritional standards and the difficulty expressed may not be reflective of the current status. Providing flexibility in adopting these evidence-based nutritional standards provides School Food Authorities unnecessary leniency in standards that improves the overall health of our youth.  
 
• Obesity and Undernutrition: In the 2015-2016 school year, 12.1 million low-income children participated in the School Breakfast Program (“School Breakfast Program,” n.d.) and 21.6 million low-income kids participated in the School Lunch Program (“National School Lunch Program,” n.d.). A poor diet has tremendous effects on the health of children including high-calorie, nutrient deficient foods leading to overweight and obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, even cancer. Some children face undernutrition from food insecurity or disrupted eating patterns from low dietary quality meals or gaps in meals all together. Undernutrition can “negatively affect overall health, cognitive development, and school performance” (“Childhood Nutrition Facts | Healthy Schools | CDC,” n.d.). To prevent both overweight and obesity as well as undernutrition, schools must strive to maintain the highest possible nutritional standards offering a variety of well balanced meals for breakfast and lunch each week. Creating a healthy eating environment teaches children the importance of good nutrition while enabling them to be more active and engaged in their learning.   
 
Recommendation:  The request to provide flexibility to Child Nutrition Program operators in adopting new USDA nutrition standards seems to lack compelling evidence and strong rationale. As outlined in the rule’s commentary, since 2012, the market for alternative whole-wheat, low-sodium food options have grown, providing greater variety for purchasing and menu building. This combined with the information from similar menu revamping efforts like the Hospital Healthier Food Initiative demonstrate that adoption and implementation of new food standards is possible in shorter timeframes. Upholding the highest nutrition standards for our youth is critical in not only fostering healthy behaviors but combats childhood overweight and obesity as well as undernutrition; all of which have lasting adverse health effects. Healthy meals make for a healthy mind and healthy mind creates a better student. ",In favor of original HHFKA

2017,FNS-2017-0021-1073,nan,Constituent,"Executive Summary As a past recipient of free and reduced school lunches I have personal motivation to respond to the changes proposed in Child Nutrition Programs: Flexibilities for Milk, Whole Grains, and Sodium Requirements. School aged children should have access to nutritious food that supports healthy physical and cognitive development. As a program with federal governmental oversight, parents and children should trust that the food served in schools are nutritious and aligned with current dietary recommendations; this is especially germane to children who participate in the free and reduced lunch program for which school meals may be the only available healthy meal option. The proposed regulatory changes will result in incongruences between federal dietary recommendations and the food being served through Child Nutrition Programs. From the public perspective, this fosters mistrust in the dietary guidelines and/or the USDAs commitment to providing healthy food for our children.  
 
Background In the proposed changes, it is recommended that schools be able to offer flavored low-fat milk and relax the timeline for schools to adopt low sodium meals. It is the purpose of my comment to explain why I oppose both of these proposals since I believe they will negatively impact the health of children. I know from experience that there are many children in the US whose sole source of healthy food come from school meals. If the nutritious value of these meals are compromised, children will suffer the repercussions.  
 
Current guideline state that Child Nutrition Programs are designed to follow the USDA’s dietary guidelines. These guidelines are based on science and medical knowledge to promote healthy mental and physical development. They are endorsed by reputable physician and dietician associations, such as the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics and American Academy of Pediatrics, and provide clarity for parents who want to give their children a wholesome diet (“Dietary Guidelines | Center for Nutrition Policy and Promotion,” n.d.). Approving the proposed changes would cause a misalignment with the USDAs evidence based guideline for a healthy diet and the food that is available in schools. If we have research that outlines what is the healthiest options for our children, why would we knowingly implement alternatives that are shown to have negative health consequences? 
 
Children that are on free and reduced lunch programs get nutritious meals while in school. These children are more likely to experience food insecurity at home, and the meals provided by school food authorities (SFAs) may be the only healthy food option they have during the day. Children receiving free or reduced-price lunches consume fewer empty calories and more fiber, milk, fruit, and vegetables than income-eligible nonparticipants (“USDA ERS - Children’s Food Security and USDA Child Nutrition Programs,” n.d.). We need to ensure that these meals remain a nutritious food source for children whose only reliable source of food is offered through child nutrition programs, instead of reducing the standards.  
 
Flavored Milk The current proposal is likely based upon research studies showing that adding flavored milk products was a positive decision for child health, as flavored milk products compete with sugar-sweetened beverages. Sugar-sweetened beverages have been associated with long-term weight gain, type II diabetes, and cardiovascular risk, whereas milk consumption is associated 
with a decreased chance of developing osteoporosis in later life for girls, therefore flavored milk was proposed as a positive alternative (Johnson et al., 2002; Malik et al., 2010; Wyshak and Frisch, 1994). However, the USDA banned the sale of most sugar-sweetened beverages on school campuses, so there is no longer a need to offer flavored milk as a persuasive option to not consume other beverages with higher sugar content (“National School Lunch Program and School Breakfast Program,” 2016). While improvements have been made to decrease the amount of calories and sugars in flavored milk, it remains that flavored milk has more calories and sugar than regular milk (J. Murdoch et al., 2016).   
 
Sodium Intake Children and parents should not have to worry about the quality of nutritious options available at school. Research has shown a connection between high sodium levels in diet and hypertension. (Cook et al., 2007; Sacks et al., 2001)We should be actively seeking to avoid meal options for children that may raise their chance of developing a chronic condition. Children are too young to think about the long-term effects of choosing a high or low sodium meal, but as the experts the USDA should only offer meals that promote health and do not increase the risk of developing a chronic disease. “The most recent available data from the CDC indicates that approximately 92 percent of school-age children in the United States exceeded the 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines upper intake level for dietary sodium (“Prevalence of Excess Sodium Intake in the United States — NHANES, 2009–2012,” n.d.). The CDC has also found that one in nine 8-17 year olds has an elevated blood pressure, and a healthy low-sodium diet can have a positive impact on high blood pressure (CDC, 2015). We should be moving towards stricter and not more relaxed sodium guidelines.  
 
Counter arguments Flavored milk results in greater calcium consumption in children, which is vital for bone health.  • While children who drink flavored milk consume more servings of milk daily, they have comparable nutrient intakes as regular milk drinkers (Murphy et al., 2008) 
 
 “Food providers need time for product development and testing, and schools need time for procurement changes, menu development, sampling, and fostering student acceptance” (“Child Nutrition Programs,” n.d.).  • The industry had over five years for product development and testing. Children across the nations should not have to eat higher sodium foods, because some school food authorities have difficulty obtaining low sodium meals. Additionally, if the food industry sees that regulations are relaxed if they do not adhere to the regulatory requirements they will have no incentive to adopt to any future regulation. School food authorities must show that they will not purchase high sodium foods, thus pressuring the food industry to meet the new need.  
 
Conclusion Adopting the proposed regulatory changes will have a negative impact on children’s shortterm and long-term health and is in opposition to the known benefits of following the USDAs dietary guidelines. The proposed changes should not be approved as they will impact children’s health and disproportionately impact children whose only reliable source of healthy foods is through the Child Nutrition Program.",In favor of original HHFKA
2017,FNS-2017-0021-1075,nan,Constituent,"School lunches help set a foundation for how our children eat as they grow and develop. School lunches also impact how a child views food as an adult. Two meals a day at school as well as how their teachers and peers speak about food and interact with food will help determine whether or not a child has a healthy relationship with their food. If children are not educated about their food and are not exposed to healthy options throughout their day, they are more likely to engage in unhealthy eating patterns that can lead to disordered eating and potentially chronic disease.
An even more direct benefit to school lunches can be higher test scores and better academic performance: (https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2017/03/do-healthy-lunches-improve-student-test-scores/520272/).
With that in mind, I strongly oppose the Flexibilities for Milk, Whole Grains, and Sodium Requirements regulation, especially with regards to whole grains. This regulation makes it easier for school lunch programs to get around providing whole grains which should be fundamentally provided in every meal. The added costs for making bread products, pizza, and baked goods over 50% whole grains is minuscule when compared to the benefits of adding whole grains to the diet. Instead of making it easier to provide less healthy, refined grains, the regulations should take a harder stance and only provide grains that are 75-80% whole grains. The benefits of eating whole grains are well-known and well-researched. They help prevent cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, increase the diversity of the microbiome, and help to maintain a healthy body weight. The following links are to studies and reviews that speak to the benefits of incorporating whole grains into your diet on a daily basis: (http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/104/1/164.long), (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4908315/), (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5310957/), and (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3554403/).
I spent five weeks in a school district providing meals for children and learning about the ins and outs of getting these meals to children on a daily basis. During my time, I never heard a student complain about the taste of whole grains. I also never saw difficulty in preparing meals with whole grains. If anything, the industry needs to do a better job of adapting to providing more and more products that are whole grains. Making it easier for them to avoid this goal is a disincentive towards providing healthier options. 
As the caretakers for our children and the providers for their well-being and health, we need to do the homework and listen to what the studies are telling us. We need to set the example and provide healthy meals on a regular basis to our children. When we don't adapt our school nutrition regulations to meet the scientific evidence, and instead, we focus our efforts on making it easier for industry to make money within our schools, we have failed our children, and we need to refocus our efforts. Our future generations deserve a strong foundation in health and nutrition understanding. Moving backwards with food regulations erodes this foundation.

Background In the United States, approximately 37% of adults, 17% of school aged children ages 6 to 19, and 9.4% of preschool aged children ages 2 to 5 are obese. [2] The World Health Organization cites increased availability and consumption of inexpensive processed foods containing high sodium, high sugar, and high fat levels as one of the biggest risk factors for obesity. Furthermore, obesity significantly increases the risk of developing severe chronic conditions including cardiovascular disease, musculoskeletal disorder, cancer, and diabetes. [3] Research indicates that majority of chronic conditions are all highly preventable by engaging in physical activity and maintaining a healthy, nutritious diet.[4]  
 
Recommendation It is my recommendation that the USDA does not implement this rule due to the various negative implications that would result from implementation. Firstly, the rule threatens the progress the United States has made in promoting healthy foods as a way to combat the leading health concerns of the nation which include heart disease, stroke, and obesity. [5] While, consumption of high-sugar, high fat, and high sodium foods puts an individual at risk of becoming obese, the condition of obesity itself  puts individuals at risk of acquiring severe chronic conditions including cardiovascular disease, cancer, and diabetes. [6] If schools make the decision to provide unhealthy food options, it will likely make children more vulnerable to these adverse health outcomes. Thus, making schools indirectly responsible for compromising the wellbeing of children. 
 
Moreover, for many children, especially those from low-income households, school breakfast and lunch accounts for children’s only possible source nutritious food. [7] These individuals should not be punished for the flaws in health equity in this country. Children experiencing food insecurity should be able to have access to healthy foods at least through the educational system which is responsible for teaching them about health.   
 
Furthermore, this rule is concerning because it presents the options of high-sugar, highsodium, and high-fat foods as a solution to the issue of children not consuming the healthier options and/or wasting healthy foods. If schools are having challenges serving healthy foods to children, they should work on a solution that seeks to promote knowledge about nutrition. Schools have the responsibility of teaching children about the health knowledge and skills necessary “to practice and maintain health-enhancing behaviors.” [8] To make healthy foods a more appealing option, schools should stress the importance of eating healthy and the consequences of eating unhealthy so that children are motivated to make responsible food choices.  
 
Another consideration is that although some schools may genuinely face challenges in incorporating meal pattern requirements because of low levels of acceptance from children, however, implementing flexibilities will give all schools more leeway in the food being served to children. This rule might even encourage schools to opt for state exemption and purchase lowquality, cheap food options in the interest of saving money without any consideration of the health of children.  
 
A final negative implication of passing this rule would be that it directly undermines the national dietary guidelines which is a report that “contains nutritional and dietary information for the general public”  based on current scientific and medical knowledge. The national dietary guidelines specifically recommend that individuals “Limit calories from added sugars and saturated fats and reduce sodium intake” and to “cut back on foods and beverages higher in these components.”  [9] Schools should provide children with food that aligns with the recommendations rather than contradicts them because doing so may lead children to not value the report as a credible source of nutritional information.  
 
Conclusion If the USDA passes the rule that allows for flexibility of schools in determining their menu based on what children like to eat rather than what is good for them, it will have multiple negative implications on the student's’ ability to actively make positive health choices due to lack of knowledge or access. The challenges schools are facing can be better resolved without the need for a full scale policy change which would result in a large, and likely negative impact on health.

As the years progress, new students are rotating in while others graduate and move onward. Participants in the breakfast and lunch programs will continue to be in adjustment to the new criteria until the lunch program requirements have reached the end goal. At that point, it will be all that incoming students will know and will have nothing to compare it to.  To add in low-fat flavored milk would be a clear step backwards and would re-introduce this option to some children that had entered the school system after 2012 and therefore do not know any different. Milk consumption may have decreased over the past few years, but I doubt this is solely because only non-fat flavored milk is offered. Many unhealthy options are typically offered a la carte that some children may be choosing instead. Whole grains and sodium need to both keep progressing to the end goal to encourage the food industry to continue producing (and perfecting) healthy options for this country's children. Although it is stated that the flexibility in these requirements would give the children time to adjust, what we must remember is the cycle of children in the school system. 
The school lunch program was originally created to provide healthy meals for America's hungry children.

School is something that all children in the United States are required to attend, and is therefore a wonderful place to educate and encourage children to eat nutritious foods. I urge the USDA to maintain strong nutrition standards for schools, especially those under the NSLP and SBP. Many children attending NSLP/SBP schools do not have access to nutritious foods; the meal(s) they receive at school might be their only exposure to wholesome nutrition... and for some children, school lunch and/or breakfast may be the only true meal they eat in a day. Therefore, it is essential to maintain strong nutrition standards and change the dialogue concerning ""healthy food.""
If children are taught at a young age about the benefits of nutrition and how food can make a positive difference in their lives, they are more likely to implement that attitude into their lives in the long-term. It is crucial that teachers and school staff speak positively about nutritious food and learn how to make it appealing to students. A diet high in whole grains and low in sodium are of particular importance. 
It is well known that whole grains have numerous health benefits. I've had the privilege of working in several foodservice kitchens within a school district, and I've seen kids enjoy whole grain foods when they are promoted in a positive manner. Several of the differences between whole grain and refined grain foods are related to texture, color, and taste. Using adequate seasoning and ensuring that whole-grain products are cooked properly can shrink the gap of student perception between whole and refined grain foods. Furthermore, the marginal increase in cost is insignificant when compared to the long-term health benefits of consuming whole grains. 
Additionally, it can be difficult to reduce the amount of sodium in foods and still maintain a robust flavor. However, by simply reducing the amount of processed food served, sodium content will also be reduced. Cooking the majority of meals from a recipe, rather than warming up pre-packaged foods, can greatly reduce the overall sodium content in school meals. 
Change is always difficult and takes time, but it is necessary to be persistent. It is well known that the United States is experiencing an obesity epidemic of monumental proportion and that many children are being adversely affected. Yet, positive changes have been made in the realm of food and nutrition, and these changes must be enforced and encouraged in the school setting as well. If we don't continue to advocate for the future of young students through quality food and nutrition, who will?

From pizza to burgers to burritos, having whole grains as the first grain provides the best nutrition, fiber content (with its accompanying staying power vs refined carbohydrates) and great taste and texture. As far as flavored milks, children don't need encouragement for high sugar items because of the increased risks of diabetes developing in our youth. This ""flexibility"" most affects the disadvantaged who may not obtain quality foods on their own for lunch and/or breakfast (and a reason for Title 1 supplementation).

2017,FNS-2017-0021-1290,nan,Constituent," I urge the USDA to maintain strong nutrition standards for meals served in schools. Newer studies on milk consumption have shown no significant decrease in milk consumption if flavored milk is removed from the menu. Also attitudes re: flavored milk removal are more negative among the adults involved and not the children. As for decreased milk consumption in high school, studies have shown this to be a problem way before the rules for the school lunch program changed. It is time we do what is best for children and not what is best for the Milk Lobby. 
These new rule changes disproportionally and negatively affect students of color. Providing flexibility by allowing schools to serve grains that are not whole-grain-rich and flavored milk with 1% fat would constitute a direct contradiction of the current dietary guidelines and result in a step back on the progress already made in promoting a healthier lifestyle, a healthy weight, and overall health equity. About 1 in 3 Latino families live in poverty, and 1 in 4 are food insecure, according to a 2017 Salud America! research review.

Even with the Obama administrations improvements, our national school breakfast and lunch programs still serve too many unhealthy options.
School meals play a central role in ensuring our countrys youth receive the nutrition they need to grow and thrive.  One in three children is overweight or obese, will have type 2 diabetes, and is already at increased risk of heart disease. Schools that prioritize nutrition are known to improve their students' well-being, help them thrive academically, and instill healthier eating habits that will last a lifetime.
Processed meat and dairy products are the primary source of fat in childrens diets and are major sources of calories, sodium, and cholesterol.  They have been linked to some cancers, type 2 diabetes, obesity, and heart disease. Researchers have found that diets high in animal protein contribute to a fourfold increase in the chance of dying from cancer or diabetes. The National Cancer Institute, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Presidents Cancer Panel, and the Harvard School of Public Health have warned of the strong link between processed meat and cancer, while the American Institute of Cancer Research has stated that no amount of processed meat is safe to eat. Processed meats and other processed foods are often very high in sodium.
Our schools need to offer more fruits, vegetables, beans, and whole grains in childrens dietsfoods that are inadequately consumed and linked to improved health outcomes  and avoid processed meat, dairy products, and refined and processed grains, that are over-consumed and linked to poorer health outcomes.  
Non-dairy beverages should be given as an option to children, not ""flavored"" low-fat dairy milk. As many as one-third of American children are lactose intolerant or have allergies to dairy milk, and many more parents are choosing to have their children drink nondairy milks.Soy milk is the only plant-based milk deemed ""nutritionally equivalent"" to dairy milk in order for reimbursement. In fact, soy milk is superior by providing key amounts of calcium, vitamin D, potassium, and protein without any of the health risks posed by dairy milk.  
The changes made by the Obama Healthy Hunger-Free Kids Act were a good start to improving standards aimed at better nutrition in our Child Nutrition Programs.   We need to not only retain these improvements but continue to do more to ensure our children are getting good nutrition.

Giving schools the choice of opting out of multigrain foods also leads to decreased nutritional value and an increased risk of heart disease, type 2 diabetes and stroke (https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/whole-grains/).  Finally, relaxing the maximum allowed sodium content is yet another backward step for the school lunch program. High salt diets over the lifespan lead to cardiovascular problems (https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/salt-and-sodium/sodium-health-risks-and-disease/).

Re: Docket No.  FNS-2017-0021; Child Nutrition Programs: Flexibilities for Milk, Whole Grains, and Sodium Requirements
I respectfully submit comments in response to the U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA) ""Child Nutrition Programs: Flexibilities for Milk, Whole Grains, and Sodium Requirements"" interim final rule (IFR) (82 FR 56703), and strongly oppose weakening school nutrition standards.  Virtually all schools (99 percent) participating in the National School Lunch and Breakfast Programs are making great progress toward serving healthier meals for low-income children with less sodium; more whole grains, fruits, and vegetables; and no trans fat; and removing sugary drinks and unhealthy snack food.   The 2012 updates to school nutrition standards support children's health and are consistent with the 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans (DGA)  and the National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine (formerly, Institute of Medicine) 2009 report School Meals: Building Blocks for Healthy Children.   
The Harvard University T.H. Chan School of Public Health concluded that the update to school nutrition standards is ""one of the most important national obesity prevention policy achievements in recent decades.""   Researchers estimate that these improvements prevent more than 2 million cases of childhood obesity and save up to $792 million in health-care related costs over ten years.  Improved school nutrition is critical given that one out of three children and adolescents aged 2 to 19 years is overweight or obese ,  and children consume one-third to one-half of daily calories during the school day.   Contrary to supporting schools and children's health, the proposed changes in the IFR could jeopardize this progress.
The three-year delay in the second sodium reduction levels would harm children's health
I oppose the proposed three-year delay (from School Year 2017-2018 to School Year 2021-2022) of the second sodium reduction targets (Target 2) for school meals that would lock in unsafe levels of sodium for children.  Unfortunately, nine out of ten children consume too much sodium,  increasing their risk of high blood pressure, heart disease, and stroke.   Many schools, food service companies, and others in industry are working toward or already providing healthy and appealing meals and products with less sodium.  USDA should address remaining challenges through training and technical assistance.  Delaying the second phase of sodium reduction puts children's health at risk and would result in children consuming an extra 84 to 98 teaspoons of salt (over the course of the three-year delay).   Further, we are opposed to any delay of the third and final phase of sodium reduction for school meals (Target 3 which is supposed to go into effect School Year 2022-2023).  
Continuing the whole-grains waiver is unnecessary 
There is no need to continue the whole-grain waivers.  USDA concedes in the IFR that 85 percent of schools have not requested waivers and are providing children with appealing whole-grain options.  If all schools in Alabama, Idaho, and Montana can serve whole grains to their students, schools in the rest of the states should be able to as well.   Eating more whole grains is associated with reduced risk of heart disease, stroke, and diabetes, provides more nutrients, and are a healthful source of fiber.   Children, on average, consume too few whole grains and too many refined grains.   
Allowing flavored low-fat milk is inconsistent with expert dietary advice and school needs
We oppose allowing flavored low-fat (1 percent) milk for school meals and as a competitive food.  The current standards that allow plain or flavored fat-free milk and plain low-fat milk are based on expert recommendations from the National Academy of Medicine's 2009 report.   The recommendations disallowed flavored low-fat milk because it would provide more calories and likely exceed the calorie maximum for school meals.  The 2015 DGA similarly recommended, ""increasing the proportion of dairy intake that is fat-free or low-fat milk"" and ""reducing the intake of added sugars"" such as those in flavored milk.   Similarly, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation's Healthier Beverage Guidelines recommend only plain fat-free and low-fat milk for children and adolescents.   
Conclusion
I oppose further delay of the sodium reduction targets (both Target 2 and Target 3), the continuation of the whole-grains waiver, and allowing flavored low-fat milk.  Rather than weakening school nutrition standards, we urge the administration to support efforts to continue the progress to improve school food.

Our children need healthy, nutritious foods at school  and these changes are a significant step in the wrong direction, jeopardizing their health, well-being, and academic success.

Changes in the environments where children spend their time like schools can help children achieve and maintain a healthy weight by making it easier to eat nutritious foods and eat fewer foods and beverages high in added sugars and solid fats (CDC, 2017). Many experts believe schools are a key setting for efforts to prevent childhood obesity. One of the main way schools can do this is with the nutrition they provide (CDC, 2017, IOM, 2012, U.S. Department of Health & Human Services, 2010, White House Task force on Childhood Obesity 2010, & Hoelscher, Kirk, Ritchie, Cunningham et. al., 2013).

2017,FNS-2017-0021-2294,nan,Constituent,"We respectfully submit comments in response to the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) “Child Nutrition Programs: Flexibilities for Milk, Whole Grains, and Sodium Requirements” interim final rule (IFR) (82 FR 56703), and oppose weakening school nutrition standards.  Virtually all schools (99 percent) participating in the National School Lunch and Breakfast Programs are making great progress toward serving healthier meals for low-income children with less sodium; more whole grains, fruits, and vegetables; and no trans fat; and removing sugary drinks and unhealthy snack food.1  The 2012 updates to school nutrition standards reflect sound science, support children’s health, and are consistent with the 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans (DGA)2 and the National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine (formerly, Institute of Medicine) 2009 report School Meals: Building Blocks for Healthy Children.3   
 
The Harvard University T.H. Chan School of Public Health concluded that the update to school nutrition standards is “one of the most important national obesity prevention policy achievements in recent decades.”4  Researchers estimate that these improvements prevent more than 2 million cases of childhood obesity and save up to $792 million in health-care related costs over ten years.  Improved school nutrition is critical given that one out of three children and adolescents aged 2 to 19 years is overweight or obese5,6 and children consume one-third to one-half of daily calories during the school day.7  Contrary to supporting schools and children’s health, the proposed changes in the IFR could jeopardize this progress. 
 
We oppose the proposed three-year delay (from School Year 2017-2018 to School Year 20212022) of the second sodium reduction targets (Target 2) for school meals that would lock in unsafe levels of sodium for children.  Unfortunately, nine out of ten children consume too much sodium,8 increasing their risk of high blood pressure, heart disease, and stroke.9  Many schools, food service companies, and others in industry are working toward or already providing healthy and appealing meals and products with less sodium.  USDA should address remaining challenges through training and technical assistance.  Delaying the second phase of sodium reduction puts children’s health at risk and would result in children consuming an extra 84 to 98 teaspoons of salt (over the course of the three-year delay).10  Further, we are opposed to any delay of the third and final phase of sodium reduction for school meals (Target 3 which is supposed to go into effect School Year 2022-2023).   
 
There is no need to continue the whole-grain waivers.  USDA concedes in the IFR that 85 percent of schools have not requested waivers and are providing children with appealing wholegrain options.  If all schools in Alabama, Idaho, and Montana can serve whole grains to their students, schools in the rest of the states should be able to as well.11  Eating more whole grains is associated with reduced risk of heart disease, stroke, and diabetes, provides more nutrients, and are a healthful source of fiber.12  Children, on average, consume too few whole grains and too many refined grains.13   
 
We oppose allowing flavored low-fat (1 percent) milk for school meals and as a competitive food.  The current standards that allow plain or flavored fat-free milk and plain low-fat milk are based on expert recommendations from the National Academy of Medicine’s 2009 report.14  The recommendations disallowed flavored low-fat milk because it would provide more calories and likely exceed the calorie maximum for school meals.  The 2015 DGA similarly recommended, “increasing the proportion of dairy intake that is fat-free or low-fat milk” and “reducing the intake of added sugars” such as those in flavored milk.15  Similarly, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation’s Healthier Beverage Guidelines recommend only plain fat-free and low-fat milk for children and adolescents.16  Further, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation panel recommended that if schools offered flavored low-fat milk, it should be no more than 130 calories per 8 ounces.  If USDA allows flavored low-fat milk, we recommend a calorie cap of no more than 130 calories per 8 ounces, consistent with the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation’s Healthier Beverage Guidelines. 
 
Additional detailed comments follow: 
 
The three-year delay in the second sodium reduction levels would harm children’s health We appreciate USDA’s efforts thus far to decrease the sodium content of school meals.  The sodium reduction guidelines in the 2012 final rule (77 FR 4088) are aligned with the 2010 and 2015 DGAs and expert recommendations from the National Academy of Medicine’s 2009 report.17   
 
Nine out of ten children consume more sodium than is recommended for good health.18  Excess sodium consumption is strongly associated with the development and worsening of high blood pressure and an increased risk of coronary heart disease, stroke, heart failure, kidney failure, gastric cancer, and osteoporosis.19  A substantial number of studies show that as dietary sodium intake rises, so does blood pressure.20  Studies show a link between high blood pressure in childhood and high blood pressure in adulthood, and high blood pressure in childhood is linked to early development of heart disease and risk for premature death.21   
 
Of concern, the prevalence of high blood pressure is increasing in American children.22 Already about one in six children aged 8-17 have raised blood pressure.23  Children are at higher risk of developing heart disease and elevated blood pressure at earlier ages if they are obese or eat too much sodium.24  Children who eat higher-sodium diets are about 40 percent more likely to have elevated blood pressure than children who eat lower-sodium diets.25 
 
The good news is that lowering sodium consumption can have a tremendous impact on public health.  Studies show that reduced sodium intake can lower blood pressure, control hypertensionand prevent cardiovascular disease.26,27  In addition, lowering sodium consumption, and thereby lowering blood pressure, can reduce medical costs.  From 2012 to 2013, high blood pressure cost the United States an estimated $51.2 billion in direct and indirect costs.28  
 
Emphasizing the alignment and strength in the science, the 2015 DGA reaffirmed the need to bring sodium consumption levels down to at least 2,300 mg a day.  The 2015 DGA recommends that children consume no more than 1,900 to 2,300 mg of sodium per day.29  Unfortunately, children on average consume a lot more than that: between 2,500 to 4,200 mg of sodium per day, which is well over safe levels.30  Along with the DGAs, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the World Health Organization, the American Heart Association, and other experts all recommend limiting sodium intake to less than 2,300 mg.31  At the current levels (Target 1), an elementary school lunch has on average 1,230 mg, or about two-thirds a day’s worth of sodium for a child in one meal.  Similarly, a high school lunch has on average 1,420 mg, or about half a day’s worth.   
 
One of the reasons given by USDA for delaying sodium reduction efforts at Target 1 is that industry needs more time to reformulate.  While reformulation does take time and resources, industry already had five years to meet Target 2 (since the 2012 final rule)32 and the proposed three-year delay would result in a total of eight years—nearly a decade to reformulate.  We are concerned that delaying sodium reduction levels could slow or prevent industry from continuing to move forward with school-food product reformulation, especially given continued efforts to further delay or remove Target 2 and 3 sodium levels.   
 
Appealing products with safe levels of sodium are now more readily available and demand for these products has grown.  For example, food companies such as Revolution Foods provide school meals that already meet the Target 3 sodium levels.  Schwan’s Company—the largest producer of school pizza—produces the pizza for Revolution Foods and has already invested in the technology and resources to make appealing school pizzas that meet Targets 2 and 3.  In addition, many companies—including Aramark,33 ConAgra Foods,34 Domino’s Pizza (Smart Slice),35 General Mills,36 Kellogg’s,37 Kraft Foods,38 Mars,39 Nestlé,40 PepsiCo,41 and Unilever42—are engaged in voluntary sodium reduction across their full lines of consumer products, which should aid school sodium reduction efforts.  This also complements state and local efforts such as New York City’s National Salt Reduction Initiative.43  A variety of methods and technologies are available to help reduce levels of sodium in many food categories.44   
 
While we are not aware of USDA collecting data on implementation beyond Target 1, we know that many schools have been working hard and are at or very close to meeting Target 2 levels.  For example, the school meals program in Elbert County Schools, Georgia has done tremendous work to get their menus down to safe levels of sodium.  They have employed tactics such as training staff to analyze sodium content in their menus; educating students on nutrition and menu changes; working with local and regional companies to find alternative products that met their sodium needs; and re-working their recipes to keep their foods with less sodium appealing to students.45  Other schools have also lowered sodium by using spice bars and salad bars that gives students more options to provide flavor with less salt.  Schools all around the country—from Virginia to California, Indiana to Kansas, Oklahoma to New York, and Georgia to North Dakota—have successfully used these best practices to meet the Target 1 and Target 2 sodiumlevels.  USDA should put greater effort into elevating and sharing these methods and encouraging their adoption by other schools around the country. 
 
USDA programs like “Team Up for School Nutrition Success” and the “What's Shaking?” initiative have been beneficial, and we are pleased to read that USDA will continue these important initiatives.  However, USDA needs to focus on targeted technical assistance that delivers more intensive and personalized training for those programs that may still have difficulties lowering sodium.  In addition, while the USDA Foods (commodities) program has set a good example for schools by providing more moderate-sodium options, that work should continue.  
 
While we agree that USDA should re-evaluate the sodium reduction targets with the release of the 2020 DGA, that should not stand in the way of implementing the Target 2 sodium standards now.  The DGAs have recommended sodium reduction since their inception in 1980, and the evidence for the health benefits of moderate sodium intake have only grown stronger over time.  USDA should continue to support schools’ efforts to work toward meeting existing DGA recommendations.  If the original timeline for sodium reduction is kept, schools would meet current DGA recommendations by School Year 2022-2023 (the third and final target) which would be close to the release of the 2020 DGA.  
 
In summary, we oppose the proposed three-year delay (from School Year 2017-2018 to School Year 2021-2022) of the second sodium reduction targets (Target 2) and oppose any delay of the third and final phase of sodium reduction for school meals (Target 3, which is supposed to go into effect School Year 2022-2023).  
 
Continuing the whole-grains waiver is unnecessary The 2015 DGA recommends making at least half of grains whole grain.46  Children aged 4 to 18 do not meet the recommended intake for whole grains and exceed the recommended limit for refined grains.47  Eating more whole grains is associated with reduced risk of heart disease, stroke, and diabetes, provides more nutrients, and are a healthful source of fiber. 48   
 
Whole grain-rich products are widely prevalent in the marketplace.  As of December 2017, the Alliance for a Healthier Generation’s Smart Food Planner, an online database that features food and beverage products that align with the school nutrition standards, shows that approximately 874 whole grain-rich products are currently available for purchase by schools.49  Further, USDA Foods provides more whole-grain products and has developed a number of resources that list whole grain-rich options.50   
 
Many schools across the U.S. are offering whole grain-rich products on their menus that students enjoy.  Successful strategies for encouraging students to eat more whole grains include student surveys, samples and taste tests, experimenting with new products and recipes, and peer-to-peer sharing of food preparation techniques.  These techniques have also been successful in sodium reduction efforts.   
 
USDA concedes in the IFR that 85 percent of schools have not requested waivers and are providing children with appealing whole-grain options.  Some states do not have any schools requesting waivers such as Alabama, Idaho, and Montana, and others do not allow waivers such as Arkansas, Maryland, and Rhode Island.51  Some states have multiple waivers for only one type of product (e.g., pasta) like South Dakota, while North Dakota does not.  If the vast majority of schools can provide whole-grain options, the rest should be able to as well.  We encourage USDA to instead provide additional training and technical assistance to the minority of school districts that currently are asking for waivers and are having difficulty meeting the whole grainrich requirements.  
 
Allowing flavored low-fat milk is inconsistent with expert dietary advice and school needs Allowing schools to serve flavored low-fat milk would be inconsistent with expert nutrition recommendations based on the National Academy of Medicine’s 2009 report52 and the 2015 DGA.53 Similarly, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation’s Healthier Beverage Guidelines recommend only plain fat-free and low-fat milk for children and adolescents.54   
 
USDA claims that the IFR is consistent with congressional intent.  However, Congress required a waiver (Section 747 of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017) that SFAs must demonstrate an increase in milk waste, a decline in milk sales, or significant negative feedback from students and parents on the lack of availability of flavored low-fat milk or palatability of flavored fat-free milk.  The IFR removes this requirement and allows flavored low-fat milk into schools without demonstrating any hardship.  For instance, USDA states that allowing flavored low-fat milk will help schools address the significant challenges they face regarding milk.  However, according to USDA’s report Special Nutrition Program Operations Study School Year 2013-2014, only 13 percent of school food authorities (SFAs) found the milk standards challenging overall—this rate was the second lowest reported for any food category.55   For breakfast, the rate was even lower, at 6 percent—the lowest reported among all challenges.56  USDA also suggests that allowing flavored low-fat milk could reduce milk waste, but cites an unpublished study.  That study suggests that the updated milk requirements would not change overall milk consumption.57  When the new milk requirements went into effect, 75 percent of SFAs stated that they did not observe any change in the amount of milk wasted, suggesting that student acceptance was not a problem.58  Further, roughly one in five SFAs reported choosing milk as the item to offer students who requested more food on the lunch line, showing that it remains an appealing beverage option for students.59  Finally, virtually all SFAs (over 90 percent) have employed strategies to encourage milk consumption, such as displaying plain milk in all-milk coolers, having plain milk account for at least one-third of the drinks displayed in each cooler, and placing plain milk in front of or before flavored milk or other sugary beverages.60  USDA should encourage these strategies and address any remaining challenges for the few SFAs through training and technical assistance. 
 
[Optional for organizations] If USDA allows flavored low-fat milk, the Department should, at minimum, include a calorie cap of no more than 130 calories per 8 ounces consistent with the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation’s Healthier Beverage Guidelines. 
 
USDA underestimates the reduced health benefits to children USDA states in the IFR that, “…we expect the health benefits in this rule to be similar to the overall benefits of improving the diets of children cited in the RIA [regulatory impact analysis] for the final meal standard rule.”  However, the proposed three-year delay of the second sodium reduction targets keeps school meals at high and unsafe levels of sodium, reducing the health benefit children would have had under the original timeline established by the 2012 final rule.  Continuing to allow a whole-grains waiver and allowing flavored low-fat milk could also lower the estimated health benefits over time—by decreasing whole grain consumption and increasing calories and added sugar intake.  USDA goes on to state that, “Further, we do not anticipate this interim final rule will deter the significant progress made to date by State and local operators, USDA, and industry manufacturers to achieve healthy palatable meals for students.”  We are concerned that delaying sodium reduction levels could lead to industry halting efforts to innovate and reformulate, and halting school efforts that would otherwise have met the targets.  The RIA does not provide a sufficiently thorough assessment of lost benefits.  USDA cites the RIA for the 2012 final rule which indicated that, “…the likelihood is reasonable that the benefits of the rule exceed the costs, and that the final rule thus represents a cost-effective means of conforming NSLP [National School Lunch Program] and SBP [School Breakfast Program] regulations to the statutory requirements for school meals.”  In the final rule, USDA must calculate the reduced benefit to children for any changes it makes to the school nutrition standards related to sodium, whole grains, or flavored milk. 
 
Background on the progress on healthier school foods Schools have made extraordinary progress toward serving healthier meals with less sodium; more whole grains, fruits, and vegetables; and no trans fat, and removing soda, other sugary drinks, and unhealthy snack foods.61   
 
Participation is increasing Contrary to claims in the IFR, changes in participation are not the result of changes to the nutrition standards.  In fact, participation is increasing.  USDA correctly states that the decline in participation is among students purchasing full-priced meals and this decline began in 2008 (five years before the updated school nutrition standards went into effect in September 2012).  However, USDA did not state that participation among students receiving free meals has dramatically increased (from 15.4 million children in 2008 to 20 million children in 2017) and remains the largest category (about two-thirds of participating students in 2017).62  Overall participation remains high with more than 30 million students participating in 2017.  Many other factors impact participation, such as sales of competitive foods, increased charges for paid meals, time to eat, long lunch lines, and school closures and consolidations.   
 
Healthy school foods can reduce health disparities Improvements in school foods have been critical to reducing health disparities and stigma for low-income children.  According to research by Bridging the Gap, prior to the updated school nutrition standards, students in more affluent and larger schools were more likely to have access to healthier foods than those in lower-income and smaller schools.63  Another study found that improved school nutrition standards are associated with a decrease in obesity among low-income students.64  While USDA claims that the IFR provides flexibility and that it is up to schools whether to use them—such as not meeting the second phase of sodium reduction until SY 20212022—in reality this could negatively impact the progress to close health disparities.  For instance, the IFR may result in low-income students in poorer schools having decreased access to healthier school meals with less sodium—which may be the only meals they consume that day— than students in more affluent schools that are already meeting or working toward the second phase of sodium reduction. 
 
Consumption of healthy school foods has increased; plate waste has remained the same or decreased Students are eating more healthy food and studies show that plate waste has either remained the same or decreased since the updated school nutrition standards.  A May 2014 Harvard School of Public Health study shows that children are now eating 16 percent more vegetables and 23 percent more fruit at lunch.65  A study released in March 2015 by the University of Connecticut's Rudd Center for Food Policy & Obesity found that students are eating more nutritious foods and discarding less of their lunches under the healthier standards.66  Children ate 13 percent more of their entrees, nearly 20 percent more vegetables, and chose 12 percent more fruit in 2014 compared to 2012, which means that students threw away less food than in the past.  
 
Overwhelming bipartisan support for healthy school meals The public overwhelmingly supports healthier school meals.  Nine out of ten Americans support the school nutrition standards.67  Nearly 70 percent believe school meals are excellent or good, compared to just 26 percent in 2010, before schools implemented the updated school nutrition standards.  Students also like the taste of the healthier school meals.  A September 2014 poll released by The Pew Charitable Trusts, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, and the American Heart Association shows that 72 percent of parents favor strong nutrition standards for school meals and 91 percent support serving fruits or vegetables with every meal.68  According to an August 2014 survey by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, the majority of school leaders nationwide reported that students liked the new lunches.69  Many statewide polls have demonstrated overwhelming support for the updated school nutrition standards.  For instance, in Alabama,70 Kentucky,71 Louisiana,72 and North Carolina,73 more than 70 percent of parents support the standards.  In addition, support for healthier school meals is bipartisan: the majority of registered voters with children in public schools are supportive of healthier school meals. School lunch revenue can increase School lunch revenue can also increase with healthier school food.  A study by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation found that schools that implemented healthier nutrition standards for meals and snacks reported revenues rebounding to original profits two years after the updated standards went into effect (in 2014) and participation in the school meals program rose significantly among students from low-income families during the same period.
 
Conclusion We oppose further delay of the sodium reduction targets (both Target 2 and Target 3), the continuation of the whole-grains waiver, and allowing flavored low-fat milk.  Rather than weakening school nutrition standards, we urge the administration to support efforts to continue the progress to improve school food.

I support the changes and agree with the changes since kids today arent eating the healthy card board that schools serve. Our children need healthy, nutritious foods at school that they wont throw away and these changes are a significant step in the right direction for their health, well-being, and academic success since many will begin to eat lunch again.
I am very concerned that the changes will allow schools to serve meals with excess sodium. Children currently eat too much sodium, which can lead to negative health effects, such as elevated or high blood pressure, and an increased risk of developing heart disease at an earlier age. 
I am also concerned that the changes will allow schools to serve fewer whole grains. Whole grains provide nutrients and are a healthful source of fiber. 
Eating whole grains and fiber is associated with increased diet quality and decreased risk of cardiovascular disease, and some studies show that eating them can lower body weight as well. We should be encouraging kids to eat more whole grains  not less.
In addition, allowing schools to serve 1% flavored milk contradicts many expert recommendations and increases the number of calories children consume. 
These changes to the standards not only have negative health effects, but they are also unnecessary. More than 99% of participating schools are already meeting the strong, science-based nutrition standards the Department adopted in 2012. Rather than weakening these standards, USDA should focus on helping those schools that need extra assistance to cross the finish line. For example, USDA should work with schools to ensure that they have the education, training, and equipment necessary to prepare nutritious meals that meet the requirements. 
Healthier children are more likely to become healthier adults. By 2025, the current healthy nutrition standards are estimated to decrease the number of childhood obesity cases by more than two million and lead to a cost savings of $800 million. With our kids developing high blood pressure, diabetes, and other chronic conditions, keeping school nutrition standards strong is more important than ever.

Rather than weakening these standards, USDA should focus on helping those schools that need extra assistance to cross the finish line. For example, USDA should work with schools to ensure that they have the education, training, and equipment necessary to prepare nutritious meals that meet the requirements. 
Healthier children are more likely to become healthier adults. By 2025, the current healthy nutrition standards are estimated to decrease the number of childhood obesity cases by more than two million and lead to a cost savings of $800 million.

Re: Docket No.  FNS-2017-0021; Child Nutrition Programs: Flexibilities for Milk, Whole Grains, and Sodium Requirements
We respectfully submit comments in response to the U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA) ""Child Nutrition Programs: Flexibilities for Milk, Whole Grains, and Sodium Requirements"" interim final rule (IFR) (82 FR 56703), and oppose weakening school nutrition standards.  Virtually all schools (99 percent) participating in the National School Lunch and Breakfast Programs are making great progress toward serving healthier meals for low-income children with less sodium; more whole grains, fruits, and vegetables; and no trans fat; and removing sugary drinks and unhealthy snack food.   The 2012 updates to school nutrition standards reflect sound science, support children's health, and are consistent with the 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans (DGA)  and the National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine (formerly, Institute of Medicine) 2009 report School Meals: Building Blocks for Healthy Children.   
The Harvard University T.H. Chan School of Public Health concluded that the update to school nutrition standards is ""one of the most important national obesity prevention policy achievements in recent decades.""   Researchers estimate that these improvements prevent more than 2 million cases of childhood obesity and save up to $792 million in health-care related costs over ten years.  Improved school nutrition is critical given that one out of three children and adolescents aged 2 to 19 years is overweight or obese ,  and children consume one-third to one-half of daily calories during the school day.   Contrary to supporting schools and children's health, the proposed changes in the IFR could jeopardize this progress.
The three-year delay in the second sodium reduction levels would harm children's health
We oppose the proposed three-year delay (from School Year 2017-2018 to School Year 2021-2022) of the second sodium reduction targets (Target 2) for school meals that would lock in unsafe levels of sodium for children.  Unfortunately, nine out of ten children consume too much sodium,  increasing their risk of high blood pressure, heart disease, and stroke.   Many schools, food service companies, and others in industry are working toward or already providing healthy and appealing meals and products with less sodium.  USDA should address remaining challenges through training and technical assistance.  Delaying the second phase of sodium reduction puts children's health at risk and would result in children consuming an extra 84 to 98 teaspoons of salt (over the course of the three-year delay).   Further, we are opposed to any delay of the third and final phase of sodium reduction for school meals (Target 3 which is supposed to go into effect School Year 2022-2023).  
Continuing the whole-grains waiver is unnecessary 
There is no need to continue the whole-grain waivers.  USDA concedes in the IFR that 85 percent of schools have not requested waivers and are providing children with appealing whole-grain options.  If all schools in Alabama, Idaho, and Montana can serve whole grains to their students, schools in the rest of the states should be able to as well.   Eating more whole grains is associated with reduced risk of heart disease, stroke, and diabetes, provides more nutrients, and are a healthful source of fiber.   Children, on average, consume too few whole grains and too many refined grains.   
Allowing flavored low-fat milk is inconsistent with expert dietary advice and school needs
We oppose allowing flavored low-fat (1 percent) milk for school meals and as a competitive food.  The current standards that allow plain or flavored fat-free milk and plain low-fat milk are based on expert recommendations from the National Academy of Medicine's 2009 report.   The recommendations disallowed flavored low-fat milk because it would provide more calories and likely exceed the calorie maximum for school meals.  The 2015 DGA similarly recommended, ""increasing the proportion of dairy intake that is fat-free or low-fat milk"" and ""reducing the intake of added sugars"" such as those in flavored milk.   Similarly, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation's Healthier Beverage Guidelines recommend only plain fat-free and low-fat milk for children and adolescents.   
Conclusion
We oppose further delay of the sodium reduction targets (both Target 2 and Target 3), the continuation of the whole-grains waiver, and allowing flavored low-fat milk.  Rather than weakening school nutrition standards, we urge the administration to support efforts to continue the progress to improve school food.

As a parent of a school aged child, I strongly oppose the changes and urge you to reconsider your decision. Our children need healthy, nutritious foods at school  and these changes are a significant step in the wrong direction, jeopardizing their health, well-being, and academic success.
I am very concerned that the changes will allow schools to serve meals with excess sodium. Children currently eat too much sodium, which can lead to negative health effects, such as elevated or high blood pressure, and an increased risk of developing heart disease at an earlier age. 
I am also concerned that the changes will allow schools to serve fewer whole grains. Whole grains provide nutrients and are a healthful source of fiber. Eating whole grains and fiber is associated with increased diet quality and decreased risk of cardiovascular disease, and some studies show that eating them can lower body weight as well. We should be encouraging kids to eat more whole grains  not less.

We want the best nutrition for all children, particularly lowincome children who may lack access to consistent healthy, quality food outside of school.  
 The new USDA nutrition standards for school meals are extraordinarily important for the health and academic success of America’s school children. Thirty million children eat lunch at school every day; more than 21 million of them are low-income children whose families are struggling to make ends meet. Nearly 15 million children (12 million of them low-income) eat school breakfast every day. Research shows that the new standards have a positive impact on the school nutrition environment as well as student food selection and consumption, especially for fruits and vegetables.    
 We are concerned about the proposed changes to the school nutrition standards, and strongly support maintaining the current, evidence-based school meal program standards to assure that all children have access to foods that support their health, wellbeing, and learning, irrespective of the school they attend.  
 School meals should be consistent with the Dietary Guidelines for Americans, including serving whole-grain foods and limiting sodium and saturated fat. This is especially important because most American children do not consume enough fiber and whole grains, and consume too much sodium and fat. The majority of schools are fully and successfully meeting the current nutrition requirements already; this is not a time for rolling back the standards. 
 To ensure that children get the full value from the new healthier school meals, we offer these recommendations to increase the reach of the school nutrition programs:  
 
• ensure that students who are eligible for free and reduced-price school meals are certified by working with states to improve and strengthen direct certification systems, and address any barriers in the school meal application process;  • encourage schools to offer free breakfast and lunch to all students through the Community Eligibility Provision, and any other federal provisions that are available to schools; and • promote breakfast in the classroom and other alternative school breakfast models.

Eating whole grains and fiber is associated with increased diet quality and decreased risk of cardiovascular disease, and some studies show that eating them can lower body weight as well. We should be encouraging kids to eat more whole grains  not less.
In addition, allowing schools to serve 1% flavored milk contradicts many expert recommendations and increases the number of calories children consume. 
These changes to the standards not only have negative health effects, but they are also unnecessary. More than 99% of participating schools are already meeting the strong, science-based nutrition standards the Department adopted in 2012. Rather than weakening these standards, USDA should focus on helping those schools that need extra assistance to cross the finish line. For example, USDA should work with schools to ensure that they have the education, training, and equipment necessary to prepare nutritious meals that meet the requirements. 
Healthier children are more likely to become healthier adults. By 2025, the current healthy nutrition standards are estimated to decrease the number of childhood obesity cases by more than two million and lead to a cost savings of $800 million. With our kids developing high blood pressure, diabetes, and other chronic conditions, keeping school nutrition standards strong is more important than ever.

Real Food for Kids is dedicated to collaborating with school communities to
elevate the quality and character of school food and to developing and
delivering programs that advance literacy in nutrition and health. Our work
over the last several years has seen great progress in school nutrition
programs and what they offer to students every day through school meals. 
We respectfully submit comments in response to the U.S. Department of
Agriculture's (USDA) ""Child Nutrition Programs: Flexibilities for Milk,
Whole Grains, and Sodium Requirements"" interim final rule (IFR) (82 FR
56703), and oppose weakening school nutrition standards.  Virtually all
schools (99 percent) participating in the National School Lunch and
Breakfast Programs are making great progress toward serving healthier meals
for low-income children with less sodium; more whole grains, fruits, and
vegetables; and no trans fat; and removing sugary drinks and unhealthy snack
food. The 2012 updates to school nutrition standards reflect sound science,
support children's health, and are consistent with the 2015-2020 Dietary
Guidelines for Americans (DGA) and the National Academies of Science,
Engineering, and Medicine (formerly, Institute of Medicine) 2009 report
School Meals: Building Blocks for Healthy Children.
The Harvard University T.H. Chan School of Public Health concluded that the
update to school nutrition standards is ""one of the most important national
obesity prevention policy achievements in recent decades."" Researchers
estimate that these improvements prevent more than 2 million cases of
childhood obesity and save up to $792 million in health-care related costs
over ten years.  Improved school nutrition is critical given that one out of
three children and adolescents aged 2 to 19 years is overweight or obese and
children consume one-third to one-half of daily calories during the school
day. Contrary to supporting schools and children's health, the proposed
changes in the IFR could jeopardize this progress.
The three-year delay in the second sodium reduction levels would harm
children's health
We oppose the proposed three-year delay (from School Year 2017-2018 to
School Year 2021-2022) of the second sodium reduction targets (Target 2) for
school meals that would lock in unsafe levels of sodium for children.
Unfortunately, nine out of ten children consume too much sodium, increasing
their risk of high blood pressure, heart disease, and stroke. Many schools,
food service companies, and others in industry are working toward or already
providing healthy and appealing meals and products with less sodium.  USDA
should address remaining challenges through training and technical
assistance.  Delaying the second phase of sodium reduction puts children's
health at risk and would result in children consuming an extra 84 to 98
teaspoons of salt (over the course of the three-year delay). Further, we are
opposed to any delay of the third and final phase of sodium reduction for
school meals (Target 3 which is supposed to go into effect School Year
2022-2023).
Continuing the whole-grains waiver is unnecessary 
There is no need to continue the whole-grain waivers.  USDA concedes in the
IFR that 85 percent of schools have not requested waivers and are providing
children with appealing whole-grain options.  If all schools in Alabama,
Idaho, and Montana can serve whole grains to their students, schools in the
rest of the states should be able to as well. Eating more whole grains is
associated with reduced risk of heart disease, stroke, and diabetes,
provides more nutrients, and are a healthful source of fiber. Children, on
average, consume too few whole grains and too many refined grains.
Allowing flavored low-fat milk is inconsistent with expert dietary advice
and school needs
We oppose allowing flavored low-fat (1 percent) milk for school meals and as
a competitive food.  The current standards that allow plain or flavored
fat-free milk and plain low-fat milk are based on expert recommendations
from the National Academy of Medicine's 2009 report. The recommendations
disallowed flavored low-fat milk because it would provide more calories and
likely exceed the calorie maximum for school meals.  The 2015 DGA similarly
recommended, ""increasing the proportion of dairy intake that is fat-free or
low-fat milk"" and ""reducing the intake of added sugars"" such as those in
flavored milk. Similarly, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation's Healthier
Beverage Guidelines recommend only plain fat-free and low-fat milk for
children and adolescents.
We oppose further delay of the sodium reduction targets, the continuation of the whole-grains waiver, and allowing flavored low-fat milk.  Rather than weakening school nutrition standards, we urge the administration to support efforts to continue the progress to improve school food.

2017,FNS-2017-0021-5285,nan,Constituent,"I'm very disappointed that The Food and ""Nutrition"" service is rolling back hard won progress in the supplementation of nutritionally inferior food offerings among many of the economically challenged families of school age children in our country.  Often the breakfast and lunch these children receive at school are a nutrient dense counterpoint to what their stressed families are able to offer them at home.  This nutritional shortchange being visited on a population that represents our hope for tomorrow is inexcusable, and certainly not excused by a need for providers to have greater ""flexibility"" in their offerings.  We can do better than this. ",In favor of original HHFKA
2017,FNS-2017-0021-5327,nan,Constituent," I am strongly opposed to this new proposed rule for the following reasons.  Childhood obesity rates tripled between the early 1970s and 2005, prompting public health researchers to predict that, for the first time in centuries, children may have shorter life expectancies than their parents. Childhood obesity rates have since plateaued at around 17 percentprogress that has undoubtedly been propelled by nutrition and physical activity policies like the HHFKR.  But we have a long way to go to change the trajectory of US population health. Half of all American adults currently live with one or more diet-related chronic diseases, and about two thirds are overweight or obese. Our kids deserve better.
Also,the medical costs associated with obesity now account for an estimated 21 percent of all national health expenditures.  That is way too much money being spent on a problem which can be fixed.  Implementing these new rules will ultimately cost the taxpayer more in terms of the health care expenditures it will lead do.  
The USDA should serve the taxpayer not the corporations which stand to profit from these kinds of changes.",In favor of original HHFKA
2017,FNS-2017-0021-5334,nan,Constituent,"I am very concerned about this reduction in the nutritional standards of school meals. The previous regulations were an important first step to address the extremely high and growing rates of childhood obesity.  The change would not come overnight, but we must make every effort to not only ensure that children eat healthy foods at school lunches, but that they learn to eat healthy foods.  For example, refined white bread may be more popular initially, but when children learn to eat whole grains, they learn to like them, and white bread is pasty.  Similarly, as long as sugary, flavored milk is available, they will not learn to drink plain milk.  The same applies to sodium levels.
As a mother whose children went through school before the regulations to promote healthy foods standards, I can say that there were extremely high levels of food waste even with the unhealthy foods.  
 
These proposed regulatory changes are designed to benefit corporations at the expense of our children's health. Schools need to work with families to address the obesity crisis that affects not only our children, but follows them into adulthood, and raises health insurance costs for all of us.

We need to teach children how to make healthy fat free choices that also have limited sodium and only whole grains so they can live long healthy lives.

Industry is perfectly capable of creating healthy food. They don't want to.  https://health.usnews.com/health-news/articles/2012/03/30/things-the-food-industry-doesnt-want-you-to-know.  This is simply a move of the industry to keep Americans addicted to sugar and processed foods.  
HHFKA bases it's recommendations on a multitude of evidence-based health and nutrition standards, including required minimum servings of a variety of fruits and vegetables in school meals, availability of free water where meals are served, and limits on total calories, sodium, sugar, and fats in snacks sold in schools. The Dietary Guidelines for Americans, an evidence-based scientific report that guides federal nutrition policy and dietary recommendations for the general public supports the HHFKA. I realize that this government is not in favor of the truth or evidence-based science, but childhood obesity has plateaued due in part to the Healthy, Hunger-free Kids Act of 2010, which was landmark legislation to attempt to curb rising childhood obesity and the associated diseases.
Our children need us to make healthy decisions for them. You have a responsibility to protect our nations's children and you cannot allow lobbyists to win over evidence-based science.

2017,FNS-2017-0021-5391,nan,Constituent,"I disagree with this implementation of changing the school requirements for milk, grains, and sodium. Healthy learning starts with a healthy meal. By lowering the artificial sweeteners in the milk, you are lowering the amount of sugar that a child is receiving during the day, thus making the after ""crash after lunch"" less likely. This is also true of the requirements of whole grains. Further, starting children at a young age with a low sodium diet will help prepare them for a healthy heart and cholesterol down the road. In low income areas this may be the only health conscious meal a child receives all day. It is important for schools to be kept to this high standard to make the generation healthier and health conscious. Additionally, being able to buy from local dairies that do not add chemicals is healthy for the environment because of the organic substances. Less risk of chemicals seeming into the soil, or animals being affected by the chemicals when the milk is poured down a drain.

I am very concerned about the proposed rule concerning flexibilities on the nutrition requirements of the school breakfast and lunch programs.
For upwards of 12 million disadvantaged school children, these meals may be their only guaranteed meals of the day and
we should make every effort to ensure they are the healthiest and most nutritious we can provide.
According to the CDC, ""The percentage of children with obesity in the United States has more than tripled since the 1970's.
Today, about one in five school-aged children (ages 619) has obesity."" The idea of relaxing the guidelines in the face of such staggering numbers causes me
great concern.
The guidelines for feeding the next generation of Americans should be the consummation of all available nutritional knowledge. The recommendations set forth in the USDA's My Plate guidelines - less fat, less salt and more whole grains - are being practiced every day by US consumers who demand healthier options from their local grocery store. If this movement is being embraced by the more health conscious adult population, why are we not reinforcing it with our young people, especially in the light of some very alarming statistics.

Healthier children are more likely to become healthier adults. By 2025, the current healthy nutrition standards are estimated to decrease the number of childhood obesity cases by more than two million and lead to a cost savings of $800 million.

2017,FNS-2017-0021-5884,nan,Constituent,"Thank you for the opportunity to comment and provide feedback on the ""Child Nutrition Programs: Flexibilities for Milk, Whole Grains, and Sodium Requirements"".  I have my bachelor's degree in nutrition and dietetics and am currently completing my dietetic internship to become a Registered Dietitian with Utah State University. I have experience working in the school foodservice setting and I have watched the implementation of school nutrition policies happen in daily functions of a school foodservice program. 
One of the most important functions of the USDA is to promote and enforce regulations to better the nutritional status of Americans.1 Unfortunately  the USDA has missed the mark with the final rule ""Flexibilities for Milk, Whole Grains, and Sodium Requirements"". 
Since the implementation of the ""Healthy Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010"" Americans have seen improved nutritional quality of the meals served to children in schools.2 Children are eating more fruits and vegetables, and whole grains.2 Over 90% of schools are successfully meeting the meal standards.2  This act has not increased food waste, but in fact has increased participation in the school meal programs around the country.2  These results reflect the success of the program. The program set requirements for serving products containing whole grains, only serving fat-free flavored milk, and sodium targets spread across several years. 
The argument for relaxing the meal standards in order to make it easier for schools to meet meal requirements is not necessary. Almost all schools are having little to no difficulty meeting the current standards.2 
If schools are already being successful in meeting their meal requirements, why would we not continue to strive for better quality meals for our schools? I have spoken to several food service directors in my community in Northern California. They have stated they will continue to serve foods that meet the current standards, including non-fat flavored milk. Their rational was, ""Why fix something that isn't broken? Kids are used to what we are currently serving, why change it?"" Instead of relaxing the goals set previously, the USDA should keep the current requirements.
The USDA should continue the current sodium target plan. There is no reason to change the plan. Most sodium is found in the ready prepared foods from suppliers. When industry is asked to adapt its products to new rules or regulations, they always follow through in order to keep their business successful. The USDA should reconsider this piece of legislation due to the nature of its trajectory. We should always be moving forward, and improving on our current standards and striving for better. 
Thank you for the opportunity to provide comment on this piece of legislation. My hope is that the USDA will reconsider the relaxation of requirements for well performing programs like the School Breakfast Program and the National School Lunch Program.

2017,FNS-2017-0021-5885,nan,Constituent,"I would like to express my frustration with the USDA decision to weaken school nutrition standards and vehemently oppose modifications to the sodium, whole-grains, and milk standards in the National School Lunch and School Breakfast Programs. The 2012 nutrition standards allow participating schools to provide low-income children with the healthy and nutritious meals they deserve. The proposed changes are a step backward, putting this vulnerable population's health, well-being, and academic success at risk.
I fear that the changes will authorize schools to provide meals with excess sodium. The research is clear; children currently consume too much sodium, putting them at increased risk of high blood pressure, heart disease, and stroke. A delay in the second phase and third phases of sodium reduction will undoubtedly contribute to negative health outcomes.
The continued authorization of the whole-grains waiver is unnecessary and disconcerting. USDA states in the IFR that 85% of schools have not requested waivers and currently provide children with whole grain options. Consumption of whole grains is associated with a number of positive health outcomes including: reduced risk of heart attack, stroke, and diabetes. Additionally, whole grains provide more nutrients and fiber than refined grains. Children, on average, do not consume enough whole grains and should be encouraged to consume more not less.
Allowing flavored 1% milk is in direct opposition to expert recommendations. The National Academy of Medicine's 2009 report, from which current standards allowing only plain/flavored fat-free milk or plain 1% milk are based, concluded that flavored 1% milk would be prohibited because it provides more calories and possibly exceed the calorie maximum for school meals.
The proposed changes to the 2012 standards are not only harmful to children's health for the aforementioned reasons but also completely unnecessary. Ninety-nine percent of participating schools are meeting the science-based 2012 standards. Instead of undermining these standards USDA should offer additional support to those schools struggling to adopt the current standards by providing education, training, and equipment.
I implore the administration to put children first and rather than crippling school nutrition standards, bolster efforts to maintain the 2012 nutrition standards and advance the progress that has been made to improve school food.

2017,FNS-2017-0021-6259,nan,Constituent,"USDA Secretary Sonny Perdue moved to make school meals great again by issuing a proclamation in support of more lenient school nutrition standards. Specifically, the proposed rule permits the continued use of whole grain waivers, which exempt certain products from meeting whole grain standards; freezes current sodium limits through 2020, rather than moving forward with progressive sodium targets; and allows schools to serve low-fat flavored milk, which is currently disallowed due to its added sugar and fat content.
My top three reasons to oppose this rule (borrowed from Sarah Reinhardt, food systems and health analyst for the Food & Environment program at the Union of Concerned Scientists):
1. We can't afford to let children's health become a second-tier priority.
Let's get this out of the way: the most worrisome thing about the administration rolling back child nutrition standards is that the administration is rolling back child nutrition standards. Childhood obesity rates tripled between the early 1970s and 2005, prompting public health researchers to predict that, for the first time in centuries, children may have shorter life expectancies than their parents. Childhood obesity rates have since plateaued at around 17 percentprogress that has undoubtedly been propelled by nutrition and physical activity policies like the HHFKAbut we have a long way to go to change the trajectory of U.S. population health. Half of all American adults currently live with one or more diet-related chronic diseases, and about two thirds are overweight or obese. The medical costs associated with obesity now account for an estimated 21 percent of all national health expenditures. Our kids deserve better.
2. We can't afford to let industry interests become our top priority.
The proposed rule cites several justifications for altering school nutrition standards, including helping school food service authorities overcome procurement and menu planning challenges, and ensuring that students receive palatable meals that won't go to waste. But according to the USDA, more than 99 percent of schools nationwide are already successfully meeting the nutrition standards put in place by the HHFKA. With full recognition of the tremendous amount of work it takes for schools and school food service staff to make these changes, the proof remains in the pudding: they did it. Meanwhile, the USDA reported higher school lunch revenue, greater fruit and vegetable consumption among kids, and no increase in food waste in the years following adoption of the new nutrition standards. So if this proposed rule isn't for schools, and it isn't for kids ... who is it for? Hmm.
3. This rule could be a harbinger of more harmful regulatory rollbacks to come.
A multitude of other evidence-based health and nutrition standards were established with the passage of HHFKA, including required minimum servings of a variety of fruits and vegetables in school meals, availability of free water where meals are served, and limits on total calories, sodium, sugar, and fats in snacks sold in schools. These nutrition standards are rooted in the Dietary Guidelines for Americans, the cornerstone scientific report that guides federal nutrition policy and dietary recommendations for the general public; as such, they were adopted with the explicit aim of curbing childhood obesity and improving health outcomes for future generations. Just as a step toward these guidelines brings us closer to a healthier future, a step (or more) away takes us further, and lays bare a pointed preference for profit over people. If the ""flexibility"" granted to schools by this proposed rule is any indication of changes to come, we may be in some trouble.

Re: Docket No.  FNS-2017-0021; Child Nutrition Programs: Flexibilities for Milk, Whole Grains, and Sodium Requirements
Dear Ms. Namian:
University of San Francisco School of Health and Nursing Professions respectfully submit comments in response to the U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA) ""Child Nutrition Programs: Flexibilities for Milk, Whole Grains, and Sodium Requirements"" interim final rule (IFR) (82 FR 56703), and oppose weakening school nutrition standards. 
The new USDA nutrition standards for school meals are extraordinarily important for the health and academic success of California's school children. While all students can benefit from healthy school meals, they are particularly important to low-income students and those that struggle with hunger. In California, 2.3 million low-income children eat school lunch, and 1.2 million low-income children eat school breakfast, each day. Many of these students rely on school meals for adequate nutrition. Nutritious school meals improve nutrition shortfalls and help address the nation's obesity problem.
Research shows that the new, science-based nutrition standards have a positive impact on the school nutrition environment. There have been many successes as a result of the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act (HHFKA) of 2010 which ushered in improved school meal nutrition standards.
	Kids eating more fruits and vegetables as a result of the improved HHFKA nutrition standards.
	Increased school lunch revenue. Nationwide, schools saw a net increase in revenue from school lunches of approximately $200 million.
	Healthy food standards did not increase food waste.  While plate waste is always concerning, the amount of waste was not increased since before the meal pattern changed.
	Participation increased substantially in many areas of the country. California's largest school district, Los Angeles Unified, saw a 14 percent increase in participation with the HHFKA meal standards.
	Virtually all schools continued to offer the federal school meal programs. Despite media reports of schools dropping out of as a result of HHFKA, 99.85% of schools continued to participate in the programs. 
We are concerned about the proposed changes to the school nutrition standards, and strongly support maintaining the current, evidence-based school meal program standards to assure that all children have access to foods that support their health, wellbeing, and learning, irrespective of the school they attend.
School meals should be consistent with the Dietary Guidelines for Americans, including serving whole-grain foods and limiting sodium and saturated fat. This is especially important because most American children do not consume enough fiber and whole grains, and consume too much sodium and fat. The majority of schools are fully and successfully meeting the current nutrition requirements already; this is not a time for rolling back the standards.
To ensure that children get the full value from the new healthier school meals, we offer these recommendations to increase the reach of the school nutrition programs:
	Ensure that students who are eligible for free and reduced-price school meals are certified by working with states to improve and strengthen direct certification systems, and address any barriers in the school meal application process;
	Encourage schools to offer free breakfast and lunch to all students through the Community Eligibility Provision, and any other federal provisions that are available to schools; and
	Promote breakfast in the classroom and other alternative school breakfast models.
In summary, we are concerned about proposed revisions to the school meal standards. The healthier school meal rules have been an important step to ensure that California kids are healthy and ready to learn. California and our nation's children need and deserve strong, evidence-based nutrition standards that support their learning, health, and well-being.

I had to stop this because she would get herself a second breakfast consisting of a sugary snack.  If it is available, 9 out of 10 children will reach for the sugar.

2017,FNS-2017-0021-6347,nan,Constituent,"I am very concerned about the FNS Rule because, we can't afford to let children's health become a second-tier priority. Half of all American adults currently live with one or more diet-related chronic diseases, and about two thirds are overweight or obese. The medical costs associated with obesity now account for an estimated 21 percent of all national health expenditures. Our kids deserve better.
As a nation, we can't afford to let industry interests become our top priority. The proposed rule cites several justifications for altering school nutrition standards, including helping school food service authorities overcome procurement and menu planning challenges, and ensuring that students receive palatable meals that won't go to waste. But according to the USDA, more than 99 percent of schools nationwide are already successfully meeting the nutrition standards put in place by the HHFKA.  The USDA reported higher school lunch revenue, greater fruit and vegetable consumption among kids, and no increase in food waste in the years following adoption of the new nutrition standards. 
My fear is this rule could be a harbinger of more harmful regulatory rollbacks to come. A multitude of other evidence-based health and nutrition standards were established with the passage of HHFKA, including required minimum servings of a variety of fruits and vegetables in school meals, availability of free water where meals are served, and limits on total calories, sodium, sugar, and fats in snacks sold in schools. These nutrition standards are rooted in the Dietary Guidelines for Americans, the cornerstone scientific report that guides federal nutrition policy and dietary recommendations for the general public. Just as a step toward these guidelines brings us closer to a healthier future, a step (or more) away takes us further, and lays bare a pointed preference for profit over people. 
For the health of our children and our nation, I urge you to oppose the proposed rule.

2017,FNS-2017-0021-6373,nan,Constituent,"I am a teacher. For years, I worked in an under-resourced public school. Most of my students received a free or reduced-price school lunch, and many ate breakfast at school as well. Over time, I observed that my students who ate school lunch frequently had less energy in the afternoon. I soon realized that students who eat food of low-nutritional value do not receive the same amount of slow-burning energy as the students who bring high-quality lunch from home. 
Concerned, I began giving up my duty-free lunchtime to go with my students to the cafeteria. I saw their limited choices, and their anemic ""salad bar"" of iceberg lettuce and defrosted peas and carrots. While I encouraged the students to eat the vegetables, I could clearly see why they avoided them. 
I was so happy to see change in recent years. While I have moved on to a private school, I have followed the school-lunch guidelines and am so grateful that students in public schools have access to better quality ingredients. My students in private school eat an organic hot lunch with a full salad bar; while my public school peers report a somewhat less robust lunch program, they are so pleased with the recent changes. 
Now I understand that these changes are in danger of revocation. This means that students will have less energy to learn. Their focus will decrease, and the achievement gap will widen. This is unacceptable. Americans believe in a free, high quality education for everyone, and proper nutrition allows this belief to be realized.

Re: Docket No.  FNS-2017-0021; Child Nutrition Programs: Flexibilities for Milk, Whole Grains, and Sodium Requirements
I respectfully submit comments in response to the U.S. Department of Agricultures (USDA) Child Nutrition Programs: Flexibilities for Milk, Whole Grains, and Sodium Requirements interim final rule (IFR) (82 FR 56703), and oppose weakening school nutrition standards.  Virtually all schools (99 percent) participating in the National School Lunch and Breakfast Programs are currently meeting the standards and serving healthier meals for low-income children with less sodium; more whole grains, fruits, and vegetables; and no trans fat; and removing sugary drinks and unhealthy snack food.  The 2012 updates to school nutrition standards reflect sound science, support childrens health, and are consistent with the 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans (DGA) and the National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine (formerly, Institute of Medicine) 2009 report School Meals: Building Blocks for Healthy Children.  Rather than weakening nutrition standards, I urge USDA to expand its efforts to provide technical assistance, support, and resources to the few schools that need the help.
The Harvard University T.H. Chan School of Public Health concluded that the update to school nutrition standards is one of the most important national obesity prevention policy achievements in recent decades.  Researchers estimate that these improvements prevent more than 2 million cases of childhood obesity and SAVE UP TO $792 MILLION IN HEALTH-CARE RELATED COSTS OVER TEN YEARS.  IMPROVED school nutrition is critical given that one out of three children and adolescents aged 2 to 19 years is overweight or obese, and children consume one-third to one-half of daily calories during the school day.  Contrary to supporting schools and childrens health, the proposed changes in the IFR could jeopardize this progress.
The three-year delay in the second sodium reduction levels would harm childrens health
I oppose the proposed three-year delay (from School Year 2017-2018 to School Year 2021-2022) of the second sodium reduction targets (Target 2) for school meals that would lock in unsafe levels of sodium for children.  Unfortunately, nine out of ten children consume too much sodium, increasing their risk of high blood pressure, heart disease, and stroke.  Many schools, food service companies, and others in industry are working toward or already providing healthy and appealing meals and products with less sodium.  USDA should address remaining challenges through training and technical assistance.  Delaying the second phase of sodium reduction puts childrens health at risk and would result in children consuming an extra 84 to 98 teaspoons of salt over the course of the three-year delay.  Further, I am opposed to any delay of the third and final phase of sodium reduction for school meals (Target 3 which is supposed to go into effect School Year 2022-2023).  
Continuing the whole-grains waiver is unnecessary 
There is no need to continue the whole-grain waivers.  USDA concedes in the IFR that 85 percent of schools have not requested waivers and are providing children with appealing whole-grain options.  If all schools in Alabama, Idaho, and Montana can serve whole grains to their students, schools in the rest of the states should be able to as well.  Eating more whole grains is associated with reduced risk of heart disease, stroke, and diabetes, provides more nutrients, and are a healthful source of fiber.  Children, on average, consume too few whole grains and too many refined grains.  
I oppose allowing flavored low-fat (1 percent) milk for school meals and as a competitive food.  The current standards that allow plain or flavored fat-free milk and plain low-fat milk are based on expert recommendations from the National Academy of Medicines 2009 report.  The recommendations disallowed flavored low-fat milk because it would provide more calories and likely exceed the calorie maximum for school meals.  The 2015 DGA similarly recommended, increasing the proportion of dairy intake that is fat-free or low-fat milk and reducing the intake of added sugars such as those in flavored milk.  Similarly, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundations Healthier Beverage Guidelines recommend only plain fat-free and low-fat milk for children and adolescents.  
Conclusion
I oppose further delay of the sodium reduction targets (both Target 2 and Target 3), the continuation of the whole-grains waiver, and allowing flavored low-fat milk.  With the vast majority of schools meeting the standards, I urge the administration to support efforts to continue the progress to improve school food, and provide further assistance, support, and resources to schools to aid with implementation, as needed.",In favor of original HHFKA

     I am a Registered Nurse and I did Nutrition Counseling on my jobs for over twenty-five years,and an completing a Certification in Nutritional Consulting.  Through my study and learning from MD's trained in human nutrition, I know that the nutritional content of food eaten especially in the growing years is critically important for construction strong ""body composition"" and a healthy brain. 
    Refined grains lack vital nutrients, vitamins, minerals and fiber that are provided by nature, even if the refined grains are ""enriched."". Fiber that is found in whole grains is very important. The National Cancer Institute says that low intake of fiber promotes many diseases, including cancer and promotes body fat.  Obesity is one of the largest health risks in children at this time.
  Also, low or nonfat milk does not provide enough fat to properly digest and absorb the nutrients in the milk.  Two percent milk would be healthier.  Also, I don't agree with serving chocolate or other flavored milks which contain sugar. Sugar contributes to the preference to sugary foods and drinks.  Sugar causes inflammation in the body, increases blood sugar which leads to diabetes and obesity, which are huge health risks for our children today.
  Please continue to serve whole grain rice, and serve two percent milk and eliminate the choice of chocolate and other flavored milks and only serve plain two percent milk or water as the beverage. 
Thank you very much for your time and consideration.

Whole grains, sugar, there is so much of it. So many chemicals. Why is processed pizza full of extra sodium offered instead of local from scratch options, even from local businesses. Is it only because of the cost? Could schools negotiate with local freshly delivered meals? Real whole meals? Can you put a price on health of our children? I know, sodium requirements would destroy the pizza businesses delivering the junk pizza to schools. Maybe it should.

I has been shown that low fat milk does not reduce obesity, especially when all that fat goes to the extra cheese on pizzas.

It is sad what is being fed to kids in Florida.
Please start caring about health of our kids more than profits. Considering what it will cost us in future in healthcare, maybe it is time to put kids over profits.

Re: Docket No.  FNS-2017-0021; Child Nutrition Programs: Flexibilities for Milk, Whole Grains, and Sodium Requirements
We respectfully submit comments in response to the U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA) ""Child Nutrition Programs: Flexibilities for Milk, Whole Grains, and Sodium Requirements"" interim final rule (IFR) (82 FR 56703), and oppose weakening school nutrition standards.  Virtually all schools (99 percent) participating in the National School Lunch and Breakfast Programs are making great progress toward serving healthier meals for low-income children with less sodium; more whole grains, fruits, and vegetables; and no trans fat; and removing sugary drinks and unhealthy snack food.   The 2012 updates to school nutrition standards reflect sound science, support children's health, and are consistent with the 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans (DGA)  and the National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine (formerly, Institute of Medicine) 2009 report School Meals: Building Blocks for Healthy Children.   
The three-year delay in the second sodium reduction levels would harm children's health. We oppose the proposed three-year delay (from School Year 2017-2018 to School Year 2021-2022) of the second sodium reduction targets (Target 2) for school meals that would lock in unsafe levels of sodium for children.  Unfortunately, nine out of ten children consume too much sodium,  increasing their risk of high blood pressure, heart disease, and stroke.   Many schools, food service companies, and others in industry are working toward or already providing healthy and appealing meals and products with less sodium.  USDA should address remaining challenges through training and technical assistance.  Delaying the second phase of sodium reduction puts children's health at risk and would result in children consuming an extra 84 to 98 teaspoons of salt (over the course of the three-year delay).   Further, we are opposed to any delay of the third and final phase of sodium reduction for school meals (Target 3 which is supposed to go into effect School Year 2022-2023).  
Continuing the whole-grains waiver is unnecessary. There is no need to continue the whole-grain waivers.  USDA concedes in the IFR that 85 percent of schools have not requested waivers and are providing children with appealing whole-grain options.  If all schools in Alabama, Idaho, and Montana can serve whole grains to their students, schools in the rest of the states should be able to as well.   Eating more whole grains is associated with reduced risk of heart disease, stroke, and diabetes, provides more nutrients, and are a healthful source of fiber.   Children, on average, consume too few whole grains and too many refined grains.   
Allowing flavored low-fat milk is inconsistent with expert dietary advice and school needs. We oppose allowing flavored low-fat (1 percent) milk for school meals and as a competitive food.  The current standards that allow plain or flavored fat-free milk and plain low-fat milk are based on expert recommendations from the National Academy of Medicine's 2009 report.   The recommendations disallowed flavored low-fat milk because it would provide more calories and likely exceed the calorie maximum for school meals.  The 2015 DGA similarly recommended, ""increasing the proportion of dairy intake that is fat-free or low-fat milk"" and ""reducing the intake of added sugars"" such as those in flavored milk.   Similarly, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation's Healthier Beverage Guidelines recommend only plain fat-free and low-fat milk for children and adolescents.   
Further, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation panel recommended that if schools offered flavored low-fat milk, it should be no more than 130 calories per 8 ounces.  If USDA allows flavored low-fat milk, we recommend a calorie cap of no more than 130 calories per 8 ounces, consistent with the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation's Healthier Beverage Guidelines.
We oppose further delay of the sodium reduction targets (both Target 2 and Target 3), the continuation of the whole-grains waiver, and allowing flavored low-fat milk.  Rather than weakening school nutrition standards, we urge the administration to support efforts to continue the progress to improve school food.

2017,FNS-2017-0021-6608,nan,Constituent,"The California Department of Education (CDE) Nutrition Services Division (NSD) has
reviewed the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Food and Nutrition Service interim
final rule in the Federal Register, Volume 82, No. 229 dated November 30, 2017-Chi\d
Nutrition Programs: Flexibilities for Milk, Whole Grains, and Sodium Requirements.
The CDE is in favor of strong nutrition requirements. The USDA went to great lengths to
align the nutrition standards for school meals with the Dietary Guidelines for Americans;
therefore, it is imperative to build on the progress made. In the last five years, California
has seen great improvement in the quality of meals served to children in the 1.6 million
breakfasts and 3 million lunches served each day. Their meals have less salt, sugar and
saturated fat, and they eat more vegetables, fruit, and whole grains. In California, both
students and parents have responded positively to the changes. As a result, we believe
that children have benefited from the updated school meal standards and we do not
recommend rolling back the current standards.
While we applaud the USDA for providing states with flexibility, we encourage the
USDA to stay committed to optimal nutrition. The CDE NSD is providing the following
comments:
Milk
In January 2012, a Healthy Beverages Jaw was implemented in California which
requires all licensed child care providers to comply with serving only fat-free or \ow-fat
(1 percent) unsweetened, plain milk to children two years of age or older. The Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010 required all school meal programs to serve only fat-free
or low-fat (1 percent) unsweetened plain milk, or fat-free flavored milk to students. As a
result, children are now accustomed to the taste of the unsweetened plain milk or
fat-free flavored milk, parents are happy with the healthier option, and dairy
manufacturers have accommodated this demand. Moreover, the caloric content of lowfat milk is 120 calories, which is comparable to the caloric content of fat-free flavored
milk, which is 110 calories. Increasing the fat in the fiavored milk would increase the
calories by 30. In addition, the CDE partnered with the Dairy Council of California and
Cornell University to promote unflavored milk through the Smarter Lunchrooms
Movement (SLM). In 2015, the CDE was awarded a Team Nutrition (TN) grant to
support SLM implementation in a cohort of schools. Through these. efforts, we have
seen positive changes in the number of students in TN schools selecting and
consuming unflavored milk, and for those schools that continued to offer fat-free
flavored milk, we have seen more consumption of the milk, as evidenced by plate waste
studies completed in their schools. Therefore, the CDE NSD does not support low-fat
flavored milk. As nutrition professionals and educators it is important to set standards
that benefit children's health and establish lifelong healthy habits for children.
Whole Grains
Not all schools need flexibility to meet the whole grain-rich requirements. In California
we received a total of 18 requests for exemption and we have approved eight out of
1 ,290 sponsors. Most schools experiencing challenges are in need of technical
assistance to acquire acceptable products or to help strategize preparation methods.
These are relatively small challenges for them to address and do not ultimately prevent
the implementation of the rule. The dietary guidelines issued by the Department of
Health and Human Services and the USDA encourage Americans to consume half or
more of their grains as whole. Yet, the National School Lunch Program only requires
that the grains be whole grain-rich which is only 50 percent whole grain. This is a step
in the right direction but still falls short to ensure that children meet the whole grain
recommendation; therefore, it is a disservice to our students to change the rule and
allow foods containing only refined grains to be served as part of a reimbursable meal.
Including whole grains as part of the meal program ensures that children obtain the
important nutrients needed as well as establishes consumption habits and preferences
for whole grains. If schools are allowed to have ongoing flexibility in offering whole
grains, then children lose out on the opportunity for important nutrients and establishing
life-long healthy eating habits. Therefore, serving whole grains exclusively in the school
meal programs is imperative. The CDE NSD recommends keeping the requirement for
schools to serve all grains as whole grain-rich with state discretion to grant exemptions to schools that demonstrate hardship in procuring or preparing specific products that
meet the established criteria and are acceptable to students.
Sodium
According to a large body of evidence, Americans, including school-age children, are
consuming too much sodium. In addition, a key recommendation of the dietary
guidelines focuses on reducing the sodium content of meals. Therefore, it is important
that schools do their part to help our nation lower its overall sodium consumption. When
comparing the sodium targets of the school meal requirements, the difference between
each target is 55-70 milligrams (mg) depending on the age group for breakfast and
295-340 mg for lunch. This is based on the average for a five-day week. Schools that
serve meals made from scratch should not have a problem meeting the requirements.
Likewise, schools serving a combination of meals made from scratch along with
processed foods are also able to meet the weekly average requirement by being
strategic in how and when they offer higher and lower sodium foods. We recognize that
some schools that are not equipped to make any meals from scratch will need to rely
more heavily on processed foods. For this reason, it seems appropriate to extend the
implementation of the target two sodium level for a limited amount of time for the food
industry to develop palatable lower sodium products rather than repeal this
common-sense requirement. Moreover, if further research continues to support the
transition to target three, then it would seem appropriate that USDA offer an incentive
for schools that currently rely on processed food to implement scratch cooking. Federal
funding to assist schools with facilities and equipment improvements in order to cook
from scratch and offer healthier food options would also be helpful in this effort to
ensure equity for all students to be able to receive quality, healthy meals.
We owe it to our children to give them a healthy start in life, to teach them about good
nutrition, and show them how to make healthy choices. For many children, school
breakfast and lunch may be their only chance to get a well-balanced meal. A recent
study published in the American Journal of Public Health suggests that students are
accepting the healthier school meals and over time we will see even more acceptance
and less food waste. Therefore, it is imperative- to maintain school meal standards that
are strong. The nutrition standards set in place promote a shift towards scratch cooking
to provide fresh, quality food, and help children understand how healthy meals should
taste and look. Providing permanent flexibility in school meals undermines the progress
already made in promoting healthier meals to our nation's students. For the health of
our nation, the CDE urges the USDA to maintain the integrity of the meal program with
strong nutrition standards for meals served in schools and focus time and resources on providing more technical assistance and funding to schools that struggle to offer healthy
food options.

Unfortunately, nine out of ten children consume too much sodium, increasing their risk of high blood pressure, heart disease, and stroke.  Many schools, food service companies, and others in industry are working toward or already providing healthy and appealing meals and products with less sodium.  USDA should address remaining challenges through training and technical assistance.  Delaying the second phase of sodium reduction puts childrens health at risk and would result in children consuming an extra 84 to 98 teaspoons of salt over the course of the three-year delay.  Further, I am opposed to any delay of the third and final phase of sodium reduction for school meals (Target 3 which is supposed to go into effect School Year 2022-2023).  
Continuing the whole-grains waiver is unnecessary 
There is no need to continue the whole-grain waivers.  USDA concedes in the IFR that 85 percent of schools have not requested waivers and are providing children with appealing whole-grain options.  If all schools in Alabama, Idaho, and Montana can serve whole grains to their students, schools in the rest of the states should be able to as well.  Eating more whole grains is associated with reduced risk of heart disease, stroke, and diabetes, provides more nutrients, and are a healthful source of fiber.  Children, on average, consume too few whole grains and too many refined grains.  
Allowing flavored low-fat milk is inconsistent with expert dietary advice and school needs
I oppose allowing flavored low-fat (1 percent) milk for school meals and as a competitive food.  The current standards that allow plain or flavored fat-free milk and plain low-fat milk are based on expert recommendations from the National Academy of Medicines 2009 report.  The recommendations disallowed flavored low-fat milk because it would provide more calories and likely exceed the calorie maximum for school meals.  The 2015 DGA similarly recommended, increasing the proportion of dairy intake that is fat-free or low-fat milk and reducing the intake of added sugars such as those in flavored milk.  Similarly, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundations Healthier Beverage Guidelines recommend only plain fat-free and low-fat milk for children and adolescents.  
Conclusion
I oppose further delay of the sodium reduction targets (both Target 2 and Target 3), the continuation of the whole-grains waiver, and allowing flavored low-fat milk.  With the vast majority of schools meeting the standards, I urge the administration to support efforts to continue the progress to improve school food, and provide further assistance, support, and resources to schools to aid with implementation, as needed.",In favor of original HHFKA

Thank you.
-JB",In favor of original HHFKA
2017,FNS-2017-0021-6640,nan,Constituent,"I strongly oppose any efforts to roll back school nutrition efforts. Here's why: 
1. Childhood obesity rates tripled between the early 1970s and 2005, prompting public health researchers to predict that, for the first time in centuries, children may have shorter life expectancies than their parents. Childhood obesity rates have since plateaued at around 17 percentprogress that has undoubtedly been propelled by nutrition and physical activity policies like the HHFKAbut we have a long way to go to change the trajectory of U.S. population health. Half of all American adults currently live with one or more diet-related chronic diseases, and about two thirds are overweight or obese. The medical costs associated with obesity now account for an estimated 21 percent of all national health expenditures. Our kids deserve better.
2. The proposed rule cites several justifications for altering school nutrition standards, including helping school food service authorities overcome procurement and menu planning challenges, and ensuring that students receive palatable meals that won't go to waste. But according to the USDA, more than 99 percent of schools nationwide are already successfully meeting the nutrition standards put in place by the HHFKA. With full recognition of the tremendous amount of work it takes for schools and school food service staff to make these changes, the proof remains in the pudding: they did it. Meanwhile, the USDA reported higher school lunch revenue, greater fruit and vegetable consumption among kids, and no increase in food waste in the years following adoption of the new nutrition standards. So if this proposed rule isn't for schools, and it isn't for kids  who is it for? Hmm.
3. A multitude of other evidence-based health and nutrition standards were established with the passage of HHFKA, including required minimum servings of a variety of fruits and vegetables in school meals, availability of free water where meals are served, and limits on total calories, sodium, sugar, and fats in snacks sold in schools. These nutrition standards are rooted in the Dietary Guidelines for Americans, the cornerstone scientific report that guides federal nutrition policy and dietary recommendations for the general public; as such, they were adopted with the explicit aim of curbing childhood obesity and improving health outcomes for future generations. Just as a step toward these guidelines brings us closer to a healthier future, a step (or more) away takes us further, and lays bare a pointed preference for profit over people.

RE: Docket ID FNS-2017-0021
Dear Ms. Namian:
Healthy school meal rules are at a critical juncture.  The U.S. Department of Agriculture can stay the course with the meal school meal standards that it established in the Healthy Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010, or regress.  A shortsighted rollback of the rule now may appease some, but long-term, the impact is on the children, and the imprint on their long term eating patterns, health, and lives.
USDA based the school meal standards on the Dietary Guidelines for Americans, which are grounded in research, and expert recommendations to assure that children are offered healthy food at school.  Further, following implementation of the school meal standards, evidence shows that the new meal pattern is making a difference in the healthy foods that students are consuming.  
When over 90 percent of schools report that they are successfully meeting the updated nutrition standards, it seems unsound to lower the bar for all U.S. school districts.  On the contrary, logic suggests that there is plenty of expert experience from school food service directors to share through the USDA by offering assistance/training to those districts that are challenged by the standards and are lagging.  Why not bring everyone up to the initial standards? 
I encourage the USDA to adhere to its evidence-based school meal standards and to move ahead, understanding that the paramount consideration is the health, well being and learning of children  especially those in greatest need  for whom the best nutrition possible should be the yardstick.

I read the proposal to allow the option to offer flavored, low-fat milk as part of a reimbursable meal for students in K-12 and while the idea of drinking chocolate milk may lead to more milk consumption, the problem is that it will also increase the sugar load for the student.    We already have a society that is obese and diabetic.  We need to proactively NOT add to that problem.  This option ADDS to the problem.
I object to this option as it is not in the students best health interest.
2.	The option to continue to use alternative grain products if the SFA can demonstrate hardship in getting products that are acceptable to students and compliant with the whole grain-rich requirement seems to read that students will continue to have too many high carb, low fiber products, like pasta and pizza, in their food.  Again, with the amount of obesity and diabetes in our young population, it doesnt make a lot of sense to continue to add to the problem.  There is no shortage of whole wheat pasta products.  I think we need a very direct nutrition education program to directly tell the kids they can help themselves NOT get diabetes or obesity by changing their nutrition habits.
3.  	As to reducing sodium in foods, you are granting schools more time to find and introduce lower sodium products, etc.  There is no excuse to not start using the products on the market now while pressuring food companies to develop new/lower sodium products.  Just look at the difference in sodium between regular Campbells soup and the healthy version (about ).

Re: Docket No.  FNS-2017-0021; Child Nutrition Programs: Flexibilities for Milk, Whole Grains, and Sodium Requirements
I respectfully submit comments in response to the U.S. Department of Agricultures (USDA) Child Nutrition Programs: Flexibilities for Milk, Whole Grains, and Sodium Requirements interim final rule (IFR) (82 FR 56703), and oppose weakening school nutrition standards.  
I oppose weakening school nutrition standards because I feel they need to be more stringent.  I don't even allow my kids to eat school lunches because I know they are so unhealthy.  Have you visited your child's school on a consistent basis and seen what they feed them? You might be surprised...
Take a look at our population of obese children...where are we heading 20 years from now? If we think health care costs are too high now, watch out! 
Schools have been forced to take over a lot of parenting responsibilities, which I do not agree with, but if that's how it's going, let's at least feed them healthier, less processed food.  Reducing sodium and sugar are two of the most important steps we can take.  Soda and other drinks like Gatorade have NO PLACE in a school building.

2017,FNS-2017-0021-7068,nan,Constituent,"USDA's School Meal Programs must continue to provide our nation's children with healthy meals that help them meet Dietary Guidelines for Americans (DGA) recommendations. I am currently the Physician in Chief of the Massachusetts General Hospital for Children, Charles Wilder Professor of Pediatrics at Harvard Medical School, former Chair of the Committee on Nutrition of the American Academy of Pediatrics, Editor of Pediatric Nutrition, American Academy of Pediatrics, and served as a member of the Committee on Nutrition Standards for National School Lunch and Breakfast Programs, Food and Nutrition Board, Institute of Medicine (National Academy of Medicine). I support the interim final rule that allows schools the option to serve flavored, low-fat milk in the 2018-2019 school year, a rule entirely consistent with the recommendations found in the IOM report: Nutrition Standards for National School Lunch and Breakfast Programs, a report intended to make the foods served in schools consistent with the recommendations of the DGA. Including this flexibility will undoubtedly encourage consumption of fluid milk by school children. Milk consumption in schools has been in decline and is widely reported and recognized (USDA ERS 2017). The decline coincided with 2012 regulations that prohibited low-fat flavored milk in school meals. Up to that point, low-fat (1%) milk had been the most widely purchased variety of milk by schools. Strategies that increase intake of nutrient dense foods, like milk, and reduce potential food waste are encouraged. The 2015-2020 DGA recommends the consumption of fat free and low-fat dairy products such as milk. Consumption of milk, a key source of calcium, vitamin D, and other critical nutrients in the diet of children, is vital for their optimal bone health, overall health and growth and development. The current regulation which does not permit the serving of flavored low-fat milk was, in part, the result of the added sugar and caloric contributions of these beverages. However, the minor increase in calories (an amount that has decreased significantly over the past 10 years) that may result from these flexibilities can easily be balanced by appropriate school meal planning. Regarding whole grains, I request that USDA restore the requirement that all grain-based school foods be whole grain-rich while recognizing that continuation of the current flexibilities may be necessary in the near-term for solutions to be developed that address current challenges faced by schools. The DGA 2015-2020 recommend that one-half of grains consumed should be whole grains in recognition of the health benefits associated with whole grain consumption. Furthermore, the DGA 2015-2020 provide data showing that whole grain intake by school-aged children is nowhere near one-half the total grains consumed. Intakes of refined grains, on the other hand, is several-fold greater than whole grain - not the one-to-one ratio recommended. School meals are a major source of nutrition for most children and may in fact be one or two of the only opportunities to consume whole grains in their diets. Thus, restoring the requirement for all grain-based foods to be whole grain-rich by the USDA is a critical step forward in helping children achieve recommended intakes. The Interim Final Rule describes challenges expressed by school operators in sourcing and serving whole grain-rich options that are equally acceptable to students. Examples of grain foods that are challenging for schools cited included ""pasta, bread, and tortillas among the most common food items for which exemptions have been requested, and other regionally popular products, such as grits and breakfast biscuits"". In fact, many whole grain-rich varieties of these foods are currently readily available and readily-accepted by children, along with ready-to-eat whole grain cereals and snack bars. Therefore, a period of three years is reasonable for schools and the food industry to find solutions that include whole grain-rich options. Finally, I agree with the interim final rule that retains Sodium Target 1 through School Year 2018-2019 and continuing the retention of Target 1 through School Year 2020-2021. Extension of Sodium Target 1 is important for both practical implementation by schools as well as the uncertainty surrounding the current Dietary Reference Intakes (DRI) for sodium. The National Academies of Science, Engineering and Medicine is re-evaluating and will update the DRI for sodium. Thus, it is logical for the USDA to wait for the review to be concluded and base their targets, and any necessary changes, on the latest science. Issuing final long- term targets before the review is complete and the DRI for sodium for school-age children is updated would be premature.

Virtually all schools99 percentparticipating in the National School Lunch and Breakfast Programs are currently meeting the standards and serving healthier meals for low-income children with less sodium; more whole grains, fruits, and vegetables; and no trans fat; and removing sugary drinks and unhealthy snack food. 
Don't weaken nutrition standards that are already successfully in place: instead, expand the USDA's efforts to provide technical assistance, support, and resources to the few schools that do need the help.
Research shows these standards are preventing more than 2 million cases of childhood obesity and saving up to $792 million in health-care related costs over the course of ten years. (The Harvard University T.H. Chan School of Public Health) 
Contrary to supporting schools and childrens health, the proposed changes in the IFR could jeopardize this progress.
I also oppose the proposed three-year delay (from School Year 2017-2018 to School Year 2021-2022) of the second sodium reduction targets (Target 2) for school meals that would lock in unsafe levels of sodium for children.  Unfortunately, nine out of ten children consume too much sodium, increasing their risk of high blood pressure, heart disease, and stroke. Delaying the second phase of sodium reduction puts childrens health at risk.  Further, I am opposed to any delay of the third and final phase of sodium reduction for school meals (Target 3 which is supposed to go into effect School Year 2022-2023).  
I also oppose further delay of the sodium reduction targets (both Target 2 and Target 3), the continuation of the whole-grains waiver, and allowing flavored low-fat milk.  With the vast majority of schools meeting the standards, I urge the administration to support efforts to continue the progress to improve school food, and provide further assistance, support, and resources to schools to aid with implementation, as needed.

Re: Docket No.  FNS-2017-0021; Child Nutrition Programs: Flexibilities for Milk, Whole Grains, and Sodium Requirements
 
As a Pediatrician in public health committed to serving our government and addressing the health disparities of my patients, I respectfully submit comments in response to the U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA) ""Child Nutrition Programs: Flexibilities for Milk, Whole Grains, and Sodium Requirements"" interim final rule (IFR) (82 FR 56703), and oppose weakening school nutrition standards.  
As a provider in one of our nation's County-based clinics, I don't just see the numbers, I see my overweight and obese pediatric patients suffering from high cholesterol, high blood pressure, asthma exacerbations and struggling to keep up with their peers.  While my earnest efforts to counsel my patients and their families to make healthier choices when eating outside the home may help, there is only so much one person can do.  Given that one out of three children and adolescents aged 2 to 19 years is overweight or obese[5],[6] and children consume one-third to one-half of daily calories during the school day,[7]  improving school nutrition is critical.  Contrary to supporting schools and children's health, the proposed changes in the IFR could jeopardize this progress.
The 2012 updates to school nutrition standards reflect sound science, support children's health, and are consistent with the 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans (DGA)[2] and the National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine (formerly, Institute of Medicine) 2009 report School Meals: Building Blocks for Healthy Children.[3] 
 
The Harvard University T.H. Chan School of Public Health concluded that the update to school nutrition standards is ""one of the most important national obesity prevention policy achievements in recent decades.""[4]  Researchers estimate that these improvements prevent more than 2 million cases of childhood obesity and save up to $792 million in health-care related costs over ten years.
  
I oppose the proposed three-year delay (from School Year 2017-2018 to School Year 2021-2022) of the second sodium reduction targets (Target 2) for school meals that would lock in unsafe levels of sodium for children.  Unfortunately, nine out of ten children consume too much sodium,[8] increasing their risk of high blood pressure, heart disease, and stroke.[9]   USDA should address remaining challenges through training and technical assistance.  Delaying the second phase of sodium reduction puts children's health at risk and would result in children consuming an extra 84 to 98 teaspoons of salt (over the course of the three-year delay).[10]  Further, I am opposed to any delay of the third and final phase of sodium reduction for school meals (Target 3 which is supposed to go into effect School Year 2022-2023). 
 
There is no need to continue the whole-grain waivers.  USDA concedes in the IFR that 85 percent of schools have not requested waivers and are providing children with appealing whole-grain options.  If all schools in Alabama, Idaho, and Montana can serve whole grains to their students, schools in the rest of the states should be able to as well.[11]  Eating more whole grains is associated with reduced risk of heart disease, stroke, and diabetes, provides more nutrients, and are a healthful source of fiber.[12]  
 
I oppose allowing flavored low-fat (1 percent) milk for school meals and as a competitive food.  The current standards that allow plain or flavored fat-free milk and plain low-fat milk are based on expert recommendations from the National Academy of Medicine's 2009 report.[14]  The recommendations disallowed flavored low-fat milk because it would provide more calories and likely exceed the calorie maximum for school meals.  The 2015 DGA similarly recommended, ""increasing the proportion of dairy intake that is fat-free or low-fat milk"" and ""reducing the intake of added sugars"" such as those in flavored milk.[15]  Similarly, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation's Healthier Beverage Guidelines recommend only plain fat-free and low-fat milk for children and adolescents.[16] 
  
I  oppose further delay of the sodium reduction targets (both Target 2 and Target 3), the continuation of the whole-grains waiver, and allowing flavored low-fat milk.  Rather than weakening school nutrition standards, I urge the administration to support efforts to continue the progress to improve school food.

APHA strongly opposes weakening school nutrition standards. Healthier school meals are
important to APHA’s public health efforts to support good health and reduce chronic disease
related to poor nutrition, overweight, obesity and food insecurity.
APHA believes the healthier school meal rules have been an important step for our nation to
remedy nutritional shortfalls in children’s diets and to help address the current high rates of
obesity and chronic disease. Virtually all schools (99 percent) participating in the National
School Lunch and Breakfast Programs are making great progress toward serving healthier meals
for low-income children with less sodium; more whole grains, fruits, and vegetables; and no
trans fat; and removing sugary drinks and unhealthy snack food.1 The 2012 updates to school
nutrition standards reflect sound science, support children’s health, and are consistent with the
2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans (DGA)2 and the National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine (formerly, Institute of Medicine) 2009 report School Meals: Building
Blocks for Healthy Children.
3
The Harvard University T.H. Chan School of Public Health concluded that the update to school
nutrition standards is “one of the most important national obesity prevention policy achievements
in recent decades.”4 Researchers estimate that these improvements prevent more than 2 million
cases of childhood obesity and save up to $792 million in health-care related costs over ten
years. Improved school nutrition is critical given that one out of three children and adolescents
aged 2 to 19 years is overweight or obese5,6 and children consume one-third to one-half of daily
calories during the school day.7
Contrary to supporting schools and children’s health, the
proposed changes in the IFR could jeopardize this progress.
APHA opposes the proposed three-year delay (from School Year 2017-2018 to School Year
2021-2022) of the second sodium reduction targets (Target 2) for school meals that would lock
in unsafe levels of sodium for children. Unfortunately, nine out of ten children consume too
much sodium,
8 increasing their risk of high blood pressure, heart disease, and stroke.9 Many
schools, food service companies, and others in industry are working toward or already providing
healthy and appealing meals and products with less sodium. USDA should address remaining
challenges through training and technical assistance. Delaying the second phase of sodium
reduction puts children’s health at risk and would result in children consuming an extra 84 to 98
teaspoons of salt (over the course of the three-year delay).
10 Further, APHA is opposed to any
delay of the third and final phase of sodium reduction for school meals (Target 3 which is
supposed to go into effect School Year 2022-2023).
There is no need to continue the whole-grain waivers. USDA concedes in the IFR that 85 percent
of schools have not requested waivers and are providing children with appealing whole-grain
options. If all schools in Alabama, Idaho, and Montana can serve whole grains to their students,
schools in the rest of the states should be able to as well.11 Eating more whole grains is
associated with reduced risk of heart disease, stroke, and diabetes, provides more nutrients, and are a healthful source of fiber.12 Children, on average, consume too few whole grains and too
many refined grains.13
APHA opposes allowing flavored low-fat (1 percent) milk for school meals and as a competitive
food. The current standards that allow plain or flavored fat-free milk and plain low-fat milk are
based on expert recommendations from the National Academy of Medicine’s 2009 report.
14 The
recommendations disallowed flavored low-fat milk because it would provide more calories and
likely exceed the calorie maximum for school meals. The 2015 DGA similarly recommended,
“increasing the proportion of dairy intake that is fat-free or low-fat milk” and “reducing the
intake of added sugars” such as those in flavored milk.15 Similarly, the Robert Wood Johnson
Foundation’s Healthier Beverage Guidelines recommend only plain fat-free and low-fat milk for
children and adolescents.
16
The three-year delay in the second sodium reduction levels would harm children’s health
APHA appreciates USDA’s efforts thus far to decrease the sodium content of school meals. The
sodium reduction guidelines in the 2012 final rule (77 FR 4088) are aligned with the 2010 and
2015 DGAs and expert recommendations from the National Academy of Medicine’s 2009
report.17
Nine out of ten children consume more sodium than is recommended for good health.
18 Excess
sodium consumption is strongly associated with the development and worsening of high blood
pressure and an increased risk of coronary heart disease, stroke, heart failure, kidney failure,
gastric cancer, and osteoporosis.19 A substantial number of studies show that as dietary sodium
intake rises, so does blood pressure.
20 Studies show a link between high blood pressure in
childhood and high blood pressure in adulthood, and high blood pressure in childhood is linked
to early development of heart disease and risk for premature death.21Of concern, the prevalence of high blood pressure is increasing in American children.22 Already
about one in six children aged 8-17 have raised blood pressure.
23 Children are at higher risk of
developing heart disease and elevated blood pressure at earlier ages if they are obese or eat too
much sodium.24 Children who eat higher-sodium diets are about 40 percent more likely to have
elevated blood pressure than children who eat lower-sodium diets.25
The good news is that lowering sodium consumption can have a tremendous impact on public
health. Studies show that reduced sodium intake can lower blood pressure, control hypertension,
and prevent cardiovascular disease.26,27 In addition, lowering sodium consumption, and thereby
lowering blood pressure, can reduce medical costs. From 2012 to 2013, high blood pressure cost
the United States an estimated $51.2 billion in direct and indirect costs.28
Emphasizing the alignment and strength in the science, the 2015 DGA reaffirmed the need to
bring sodium consumption levels down to at least 2,300 mg a day. The 2015 DGA recommends
that children consume no more than 1,900 to 2,300 mg of sodium per day.29 Unfortunately,
children on average consume a lot more than that: between 2,500 to 4,200 mg of sodium per day,
which is well over safe levels.30 Along with the DGAs, the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention, the World Health Organization, the American Heart Association, and other experts
all recommend limiting sodium intake to less than 2,300 mg.31 At the current levels (Target 1),
an elementary school lunch has on average 1,230 mg, or about two-thirds a day’s worth of
sodium for a child in one meal. Similarly, a high school lunch has on average 1,420 mg, or about
half a day’s worth.
One of the reasons given by USDA for delaying sodium reduction efforts at Target 1 is that
industry needs more time to reformulate. While reformulation does take time and resourcesindustry already had five years to meet Target 2 (since the 2012 final rule)
32 and the proposed
three-year delay would result in a total of eight years—nearly a decade to reformulate. APHA is
concerned that delaying sodium reduction levels could slow or prevent industry from continuing
to move forward with school-food product reformulation, especially given continued efforts to
further delay or remove Target 2 and 3 sodium levels.
Appealing products with safe levels of sodium are now more readily available and demand for
these products has grown. For example, food companies such as Revolution Foods provide
school meals that already meet the Target 3 sodium levels. Schwan’s Company—the largest
producer of school pizza—produces the pizza for Revolution Foods and has already invested in
the technology and resources to make appealing school pizzas that meet Targets 2 and 3. In
addition, many companies—including Aramark,33 ConAgra Foods,34 Domino’s Pizza (Smart
Slice),35 General Mills,36 Kellogg’s,
37 Kraft Foods,
38 Mars,39 Nestlé,40 PepsiCo,41 and
Unilever42—are engaged in voluntary sodium reduction across their full lines of consumer
products, which should aid school sodium reduction efforts. This also complements state and
local efforts such as New York City’s National Salt Reduction Initiative.43 A variety of methods
and technologies are available to help reduce levels of sodium in many food categories.44
While APHA is not aware of USDA collecting data on implementation beyond Target 1, we
know that many schools have been working hard and are at or very close to meeting Target 2levels. For example, the school meals program in Elbert County Schools, Georgia has done
tremendous work to get their menus down to safe levels of sodium. They have employed tactics
such as training staff to analyze sodium content in their menus; educating students on nutrition
and menu changes; working with local and regional companies to find alternative products that
met their sodium needs; and re-working their recipes to keep their foods with less sodium
appealing to students.45 Other schools have also lowered sodium by using spice bars and salad
bars that gives students more options to provide flavor with less salt. Schools all around the
country—from Virginia to California, Indiana to Kansas, Oklahoma to New York, and Georgia
to North Dakota—have successfully used these best practices to meet the Target 1 and Target 2
sodium levels. USDA should put greater effort into elevating and sharing these methods and
encouraging their adoption by other schools around the country.
USDA programs like “Team Up for School Nutrition Success” and the “What's Shaking?”
initiative have been beneficial, and APHA is pleased to read that USDA will continue these
important initiatives. However, USDA needs to focus on targeted technical assistance that
delivers more intensive and personalized training for those programs that may still have
difficulties lowering sodium. In addition, while the USDA Foods (commodities) program has set
a good example for schools by providing more moderate-sodium options, that work should
continue.
While APHA agrees that USDA should re-evaluate the sodium reduction targets with the release
of the 2020 DGA, that should not stand in the way of implementing the Target 2 sodium
standards now. The DGAs have recommended sodium reduction since their inception in 1980,
and the evidence for the health benefits of moderate sodium intake have only grown stronger
over time. USDA should continue to support schools’ efforts to work toward meeting existing
DGA recommendations. If the original timeline for sodium reduction is kept, schools would
meet current DGA recommendations by School Year 2022-2023 (the third and final target)
which would be close to the release of the 2020 DGA.
In summary, we oppose the proposed three-year delay (from School Year 2017-2018 to School
Year 2021-2022) of the second sodium reduction targets (Target 2) and opposes any delay of the
third and final phase of sodium reduction for school meals (Target 3, which is supposed to go
into effect School Year 2022-2023).
Continuing the whole-grains waiver is unnecessary
The 2015 DGA recommends making at least half of grains whole grain.46 Children aged 4 to 18
do not meet the recommended intake for whole grains and exceed the recommended limit for
refined grains.47 Eating more whole grains is associated with reduced risk of heart disease,
stroke, and diabetes, provides more nutrients, and is a healthful source of fiber. 48Whole grain-rich products are widely prevalent in the marketplace. As of December 2017, the
Alliance for a Healthier Generation’s Smart Food Planner, an online database that features food
and beverage products that align with the school nutrition standards, shows that approximately
874 whole grain-rich products are currently available for purchase by schools.49 Further, USDA
Foods provides more whole-grain products and has developed a number of resources that list
whole grain-rich options.
50
Many schools across the U.S. are offering whole grain-rich products on their menus that students
enjoy. Successful strategies for encouraging students to eat more whole grains include student
surveys, samples and taste tests, experimenting with new products and recipes, and peer-to-peer
sharing of food preparation techniques. These techniques have also been successful in sodium
reduction efforts.
USDA concedes in the IFR that 85 percent of schools have not requested waivers and are
providing children with appealing whole-grain options. Some states do not have any schools
requesting waivers such as Alabama, Idaho, and Montana, and others do not allow waivers such
as Arkansas, Maryland, and Rhode Island.
51 Some states have multiple waivers for only one type
of product (e.g., pasta) like South Dakota, while North Dakota does not. If the vast majority of
schools can provide whole-grain options, the rest should be able to as well. APHA encourages
USDA to instead provide additional training and technical assistance to the minority of school
districts that currently are asking for waivers and are having difficulty meeting the whole grainrich requirements.
Allowing flavored low-fat milk is inconsistent with expert dietary advice and school needs
Allowing schools to serve flavored low-fat milk would be inconsistent with expert nutrition
recommendations based on the National Academy of Medicine’s 2009 report52 and the 2015 DGA.53 Similarly, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation’s Healthier Beverage Guidelines
recommend only plain fat-free and low-fat milk for children and adolescents.
54
USDA claims that the IFR is consistent with congressional intent. However, Congress required a
waiver (Section 747 of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017) that SFAs must demonstrate
an increase in milk waste, a decline in milk sales, or significant negative feedback from students
and parents on the lack of availability of flavored low-fat milk or palatability of flavored fat-free
milk. The IFR removes this requirement and allows flavored low-fat milk into schools without
demonstrating any hardship. For instance, USDA states that allowing flavored low-fat milk will
help schools address the significant challenges they face regarding milk. However, according to
USDA’s report Special Nutrition Program Operations Study School Year 2013-2014, only 13
percent of school food authorities (SFAs) found the milk standards challenging overall—this rate
was the second lowest reported for any food category.55 For breakfast, the rate was even lower,
at 6 percent—the lowest reported among all challenges.
56 USDA also suggests that allowing
flavored low-fat milk could reduce milk waste, but cites an unpublished study. That study
suggests that the updated milk requirements would not change overall milk consumption.57
When the new milk requirements went into effect, 75 percent of SFAs stated that they did not
observe any change in the amount of milk wasted, suggesting that student acceptance was not a
problem.58 Further, roughly one in five SFAs reported choosing milk as the item to offer students
who requested more food on the lunch line, showing that it remains an appealing beverage option
for students.
59 Finally, virtually all SFAs (over 90 percent) have employed strategies to
encourage milk consumption, such as displaying plain milk in all-milk coolers, having plain milk
account for at least one-third of the drinks displayed in each cooler, and placing plain milk in
front of or before flavored milk or other sugary beverages.60 USDA should encourage these
strategies and address any remaining challenges for the few SFAs through training and technical
assistance.
USDA underestimates the reduced health benefits to children
USDA states in the IFR that, “…we expect the health benefits in this rule to be similar to the
overall benefits of improving the diets of children cited in the RIA [regulatory impact analysis]
for the final meal standard rule.” However, the proposed three-year delay of the second sodium
reduction targets keeps school meals at high and unsafe levels of sodium, reducing the health
benefit children would have had under the original timeline established by the 2012 final rule.
Continuing to allow a whole-grains waiver and allowing flavored low-fat milk could also lower
the estimated health benefits over time—by decreasing whole grain consumption and increasing calories and added sugar intake. USDA goes on to state that, “Further, we do not anticipate this
interim final rule will deter the significant progress made to date by State and local operators,
USDA, and industry manufacturers to achieve healthy palatable meals for students.” APHA is
concerned that delaying sodium reduction levels could lead to industry halting efforts to innovate
and reformulate, and halting school efforts that would otherwise have met the targets. The RIA
does not provide a sufficiently thorough assessment of lost benefits. USDA cites the RIA for the
2012 final rule which indicated that, “…the likelihood is reasonable that the benefits of the rule
exceed the costs, and that the final rule thus represents a cost-effective means of conforming
NSLP [National School Lunch Program] and SBP [School Breakfast Program] regulations to the
statutory requirements for school meals.” In the final rule, USDA must calculate the reduced
benefit to children for any changes it makes to the school nutrition standards related to sodium,
whole grains, or flavored milk.
Background on the progress on healthier school foods
Schools have made extraordinary progress toward serving healthier meals with less sodium;
more whole grains, fruits, and vegetables; and no trans fat, and removing soda, other sugary
drinks, and unhealthy snack foods.
61
Participation is increasing
Contrary to claims in the IFR, changes in participation are not the result of changes to the
nutrition standards. In fact, participation is increasing. USDA correctly states that the decline in
participation is among students purchasing full-priced meals and this decline began in 2008 (five
years before the updated school nutrition standards went into effect in September 2012).
However, USDA did not state that participation among students receiving free meals has
dramatically increased (from 15.4 million children in 2008 to 20 million children in 2017) and
remains the largest category (about two-thirds of participating students in 2017).62 Overall
participation remains high with more than 30 million students participating in 2017. Many other
factors impact participation, such as sales of competitive foods, increased charges for paid meals,
time to eat, long lunch lines, and school closures and consolidations.
Healthy school foods can reduce health disparities
Improvements in school foods have been critical to reducing health disparities and stigma for
low-income children. According to research by Bridging the Gap, prior to the updated school
nutrition standards, students in more affluent and larger schools were more likely to have access
to healthier foods than those in lower-income and smaller schools.63 Another study found that
improved school nutrition standards are associated with a decrease in obesity among low-income students.64 While USDA claims that the IFR provides flexibility and that it is up to schools
whether to use them—such as not meeting the second phase of sodium reduction until SY 2021-
2022—in reality this could negatively impact the progress to close health disparities. For
instance, the IFR may result in low-income students in poorer schools having decreased access to
healthier school meals with less sodium—which may be the only meals they consume that day—
than students in more affluent schools that are already meeting or working toward the second
phase of sodium reduction.
Consumption of healthy school foods has increased; plate waste has remained the same or
decreasedStudents are eating more healthy food and studies show that plate waste has either remained the
same or decreased since the updated school nutrition standards. A May 2014 Harvard School of
Public Health study shows that children are now eating 16 percent more vegetables and 23
percent more fruit at lunch.65 A study released in March 2015 by the University of Connecticut's
Rudd Center for Food Policy & Obesity found that students are eating more nutritious foods and
discarding less of their lunches under the healthier standards.66 Children ate 13 percent more of
their entrees, nearly 20 percent more vegetables, and chose 12 percent more fruit in 2014
compared to 2012, which means that students threw away less food than in the past.

It is simply crazy not to try to protect our kids from the effects of poor quality foods that keep them from learning at their best and cause lots of health problems later on, as witnessed by our nation's growing obesity and diabetes crisis!
It's critical that we encourage kids to eat a more wholesome diet by what they are served at school. Serving whole grains, minimizing sodium levels, and avoiding sugary milk drinks is in the best interest of our kids--and the future of our country!

2017,FNS-2017-0021-7140,nan,Constituent,"I oppose the rolling back of child nutrition standards. Childhood obesity rates tripled between the early 1970s and 2005, prompting public health researchers to predict that, for the first time in centuries, children may have shorter life expectancies than their parents. Childhood obesity rates have since plateaued at around 17 percentprogress that has undoubtedly been propelled by nutrition and physical activity policies like the HHFKAbut we have a long way to go to change the trajectory of U.S. population health. Half of all American adults currently live with one or more diet-related chronic diseases, and about two thirds are overweight or obese. The medical costs associated with obesity now account for an estimated 21 percent of all national health expenditures. Our kids deserve better.
I oppose allowing food industry special interests to dictate school nutrition standards. The proposed rule cites several justifications for altering school nutrition standards, including helping school food service authorities overcome procurement and menu planning challenges, and ensuring that students receive palatable meals that won't go to waste. But according to the USDA, more than 99 percent of schools nationwide are already successfully meeting the nutrition standards put in place by the HHFKA. With full recognition of the tremendous amount of work it takes for schools and school food service staff to make these changes, the proof remains in the pudding: they did it. Meanwhile, the USDA reported higher school lunch revenue, greater fruit and vegetable consumption among kids, and no increase in food waste in the years following adoption of the new nutrition standards.
A multitude of other evidence-based health and nutrition standards were established with the passage of HHFKA, including required minimum servings of a variety of fruits and vegetables in school meals, availability of free water where meals are served, and limits on total calories, sodium, sugar, and fats in snacks sold in schools. These nutrition standards are rooted in the Dietary Guidelines for Americans, the cornerstone scientific report that guides federal nutrition policy and dietary recommendations for the general public; as such, they were adopted with the explicit aim of curbing childhood obesity and improving health outcomes for future generations. Just as a step toward these guidelines brings us closer to a healthier future, a step (or more) away takes us further, and lays bare a pointed preference for profit over people.

2017,FNS-2017-0021-7166,nan,Constituent,"The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF) appreciates the opportunity to submit comments
in response to the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) “Child Nutrition Programs:
Flexibilities for Milk, Whole Grains, and Sodium Requirements” interim final rule (IFR) (82 FR
56703).
Every child deserves to attend schools that provide nutritious foods and drinks and opportunities
to be physically active. The recent nutrition updates to school meals have been an extraordinary
achievement benefitting the 30 million children who eat school lunches nearly three-quarters of
whom qualify for free or reduced-price meals.1 For children from low-income families, school
meals are an especially critical source of affordable, healthy foods.
Research shows that our nation’s schools have implemented the nutrition standards changes and
are offering healthier meals. It shows that students like the lunches and are eating more of them.2
Additionally, national surveys confirm that parents support the healthier standards.
3 Yet despite
this clear and convincing record of success, the interim final rule would unnecessarily weaken
the current standards and roll back the tremendous progress schools have made in serving
healthier meals in recent years. 
2
We urge USDA to support students’ health and well-being by fully implementing the school
nutrition standards that took effect in 2012.
4
The 2012 updates to school nutrition standards—the first such updates in more than 15 years—
were transformative, reflecting sound science and supporting children’s health. The standards
have led to meals with more fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, with far less sodium, saturated
fats, and added sugars.5 Sugary drinks, unhealthy snack foods, and trans fats have been removed
as well. These changes are consistent with the 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans
(DGA)6 and the National Academy of Medicine (formerly, Institute of Medicine) 2009 report
School Meals: Building Blocks for Healthy Children.
7
Recent demographic changes in the United States illustrate the importance of healthy school
meals. According to recent data from the National Center for Education Statistics, a majority of
students in our nation’s public schools—51 percent—now qualify for free and reduced-price
school meals.8 In addition, with low-income, Black and Latino students at highest risk for
obesity,9 ensuring that schools serve nutritious food is a core component of efforts to provide a
fair and just opportunity for all children to achieve a healthy weight and mitigate the negative
health effects of poverty.
Virtually all schools across the country—99 percent—have implemented the 2012 nutrition
standards successfully, with more than half of states reporting 100 percent compliance.
In addition, food and beverage companies have worked diligently to reformulate and modify
products to comply with the healthier standards and school budgets. The effects of industry
changes have been far-reaching, even prior to the healthier standards taking effect: for example,
the implementation of school beverage guidelines brokered between the Alliance for a Healthier
Generation and major beverage companies resulted in a 90 percent reduction in calories from
beverages shipped to schools between 2004 and 2010.
10 Rolling back the standards now would
send the wrong message to companies that they no longer need to prioritize their positive efforts
to improve the nutritional profile of foods and beverages.
A growing body of research suggests the updated standards are working as intended:
• A Healthy Eating Research study examining 1.7 million meals served in six schools in an
urban Washington school district found that the meals’ overall nutritional quality
increased by 29 percent under the 2012 standards.11
• Bridging the Gap surveys of school leaders nationwide revealed widespread student
acceptance of the updated standards. Seventy percent of elementary school leaders
reported that students generally like the healthier school lunches; school leaders reported
similar results from 70 percent of middle schoolers and 63 percent of high school
students.
12
• A Rudd Center for Food Policy & Obesity study examining 12 middle schools in an
urban, low income school district study found that more students chose fruit after the
2012 standards went into effect (66 percent, up from 54 percent) and that students ate
more of their vegetables (64 percent, up from 46 percent) and lunch entrees (84 percent,
up from 71 percent).13
3
• A study examining low-income, predominantly minority public schools in four New
Jersey cities before and after implementation of the 2012 standards found that school
lunch participation between 2008 and 2015 rose slightly from 70 percent to 72 percent,
while school breakfast participation held steady before rising between 2013 and 2015
from 52 percent to 59 percent. Researchers concluded that the updated nutrition standards
have not affected school meal participation rates and over time, students are likely to
accept healthier options.
14
• A poll released by the Pew Charitable Trusts, RWJF, and the American Heart
Association found that among registered voter parents with school-age children, more
than 70 percent of those surveyed support the 2012 nutrition standards.15
Schools and school food service professionals have made great progress toward serving healthier
meals that children enjoy eating. Since 2009, USDA has provided more than $200 million in
kitchen equipment grants to help thousands of schools upgrade their facilities and infrastructure.
A nationally representative survey of school nutrition directors commissioned by the Kids’ Safe
and Healthful Foods Project—a joint collaboration between the Pew Charitable Trusts and
RWJF—found that most meal programs use a mix of strategies to encourage students to eat
nutritious meals, such as the installation of salad bars and holding taste tests with students.16
Maintaining and building on this progress is critical to helping children grow up healthy. The
United States is at a crossroads in its efforts to ensure all children are able to achieve a healthy
weight. The overall rise in rates of childhood obesity has slowed in recent years and some states,
cities, and counties have reported declines.
17 Yet the latest data show that 18.5 percent of
children were obese in 2015-16, the highest rate ever recorded by the National Health and
Nutrition Examination Survey18—a stark reminder that obesity continues to threaten our nation’s
health, economy, and future.
Researchers from Harvard University’s T.H. Chan School of Public Health have concluded that
the 2012 school nutrition standards are “one of the most important national obesity prevention
policy achievements in recent decades.”19 Researchers estimate that these improvements will
prevent more than two million cases of childhood obesity and save up to $792 million in healthcare related costs over ten years. Given that children consume up to half of their daily calories
during the school day,
20 the 2012 school nutrition standards deserve USDA’s full support.
The changes to the school meals standards proposed in the interim final rule would undermine
this progress.
The three-year delay in implementing the Target 2 sodium reduction levels would harm
children’s health.
The 2012 standards included a multi-year plan for reducing sodium levels in school meals.21 The
initial round of reductions, known as Target 1, were implemented for the 2014-15 school. The
next round of reductions, known as Target 2, were scheduled to take effect for the 2017-18
school year. But Congress has delayed implementation of Target 2, and the rule proposes to push
the deadline back by several more years. 
4
Such a delay only hurts children’s health. Even with the successful implementation of Target 1
reductions, nine out of ten children still consume too much sodium,
22 increasing their risk of
high blood pressure, heart disease, and stroke.23 Many schools, food service companies, and
others in industry are already providing healthy and appealing meals and products with less
sodium. USDA should implement Target 2 and Target 3 sodium reduction levels under the
current timeline, and continue to provide training and technical assistance so that all schools can
meet these benchmarks.
Continuing the whole-grains waiver is unnecessary.
Eating more whole grains is associated with reduced risk of heart disease, stroke, and diabetes.
Whole grains provide more nutrients and are a healthful source of fiber,24 yet children on
average consume too few whole grains and too many refined grains.25 Per USDA, 85 percent of
schools nationwide have not requested waivers from the current whole-grain requirements.26
Allowing flavored low-fat milk is inconsistent with expert dietary advice and school needs.
The current standards that permit only plain or flavored fat-free milk and plain low-fat milk are
based on expert recommendations from the National Academy of Medicine,27 which noted that
the calories from flavored low-fat milk would likely push school meals past overall calorie limits
due to the added sugar from the flavoring, such as chocolate or strawberry flavoring. The 2015
DGA likewise recommended “increasing the proportion of dairy intake that is fat-free or low-fat
milk” and “reducing the intake of added sugars” such as those in flavored milk.28 Similarly,
RWJF’s Healthy Eating Research Healthier Beverage Guidelines recommend only plain fat-free
and low-fat milk for children and adolescents.
29
If USDA allows flavored low-fat milk, we recommend a calorie cap of no more than 130 calories
per 8 ounces, consistent with RWJF’s Healthier Beverage Guidelines.
Conclusion
To truly appreciate how far school meals have come in terms of improved nutrition, it is
instructive to remember where they were not too long ago. As recently as the 2004-05 school
year,30 43 percent of school lunches included pre-packaged foods high in calories, sodium, and
saturated fat, such as burritos, pizza, or chicken nuggets. Forty-two percent of schools did not
offer fresh fruits or vegetables daily in school lunches. Whole grain products were offered in
fewer than 5 percent of lunches.
To say the least, the school meals students enjoy today look quite different, and the health
benefits extend far beyond the cafeteria. Studies show that eating regular breakfast, including
breakfast at school, has cognitive benefits, including a mainly positive effect on on-task behavior
in the classroom and children’s academic performance.
31 Kids can share healthy eating habits
with their peers. Additionally, they can bring these lessons home, helping to empower their
families to make healthy choices in their communities at grocery stores, restaurants, or farmers’
markets – even when on a tight budget. 
5
The implementation of the current school nutrition standards has been a remarkably successful
endeavor. We applaud the school officials and food service personnel who have worked
diligently on behalf of the students they serve, and stand with the parents and industry leaders
who have been so supportive of these efforts. We urge USDA to use its rulemaking authority to
maintain and strengthen, not weaken, the current standards – especially for the 22 million
children who receive free and reduced-price meals. For them, school breakfast and lunch are
more than a meal; they are a lifeline. We must not let them down.

I strongly disapprove of this interim rule, effective 2018-2019, which would allow schools to serve 1% and nonfat flavored and non-flavored milk, refined grains over whole grains, and higher-salt levels in meals.
This proposal greatly rolls back progress to improve school nutrition and childrens health.
For the health of all children, it is critical to maintain strong nutrition standards for meals served in schools. 
Children are at a vulnerable developmental stage that require healthy foods to reach their optimal potential.
Our brain requires fats to operate, so stripping milk of its fat based nutrients, and the fat used by the brain as fuel, is actually depriving vulnerable students of strong mental and physical foundations for learning.
There are many behavioral studies regarding highly processed foods contributing to attention deficit disorder and the curtailed ability to learn and process information.
Providing flexibility by allowing schools to serve grains that are not whole-grain-rich and flavored milk with 1% fat would constitute a direct contradiction of the current dietary guidelines. 
This proposal is a step backwards on the progress already made to promote a healthier lifestyle, to reduce childhood obesity and diabetes, and to give every child equal possibilities to thrive and prosper.
For many children living in poverty, school is their only chance to get a well-balanced meal. 
Please maintain high standards when it comes to serving nutritious food in schools.

We respectfully submit this letter in response to the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s (USDA)
“Child Nutrition Programs: Flexibilities for Milk, Whole Grains, and Sodium Requirements”
interim final rule (IFR) (82 FR 56703), and oppose that proposal to weaken school nutrition.
Virtually all schools (99 percent) participating in the National School Lunch and Breakfast
Programs are making great progress toward serving healthier meals for low-income children with
less sodium; more whole grains, fruits, and vegetables; and no trans fat; and removing sugary
drinks and unhealthy snack food.1
 The 2012 updates to school nutrition standards reflect sound
science, support children’s health, and are consistent with the 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for
Americans (DGA)2
and the National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine
(formerly, Institute of Medicine) 2009 report School Meals: Building Blocks for Healthy
Children.
3
The Harvard University T.H. Chan School of Public Health concluded that the update to school
nutrition standards is “one of the most important national obesity prevention policy achievements
in recent decades.”4
 Researchers estimate that these improvements prevent more than 2 million
cases of childhood obesity and save up to $792 million in health-care related costs over ten
years. Improved school nutrition is critical given that one out of three children and adolescents
aged 2 to 19 years is overweight or obese5,6
and children consume one-third to one-half of daily
calories during the school day.7
 Contrary to supporting schools and children’s health, the
proposed changes in the IFR could jeopardize this progress.
We oppose the proposed three-year delay (from School Year 2017-2018 to School Year 2021-
2022) of the second sodium reduction targets (Target 2) for school meals that would lock in
unsafe levels of sodium for children. Unfortunately, nine out of ten children consume too much sodium,8
increasing their risk of high blood pressure, heart disease, and stroke.9
 Many schools,
food service companies, and others in industry are working toward or already providing healthy
and appealing meals and products with less sodium. USDA should address remaining challenges
through training and technical assistance. Delaying the second phase of sodium reduction puts
children’s health at risk and would result in children consuming an extra 84 to 98 teaspoons of
salt (over the course of the three-year delay).10
 Further, we are opposed to any delay of the third
and final phase of sodium reduction for school meals (Target 3 which is supposed to go into
effect School Year 2022-2023).
There is no need to continue the whole-grain waivers. USDA concedes in the IFR that 85
percent of schools have not requested waivers and are providing children with appealing wholegrain options. All schools in Alabama, Idaho, and Montana can serve whole grains to their
students, so schools in the rest of the states should be able to as well.11
 Eating more whole grains
is associated with reduced risk of heart disease, stroke, and diabetes, provides more nutrients,
and are a healthful source of fiber.12
 Children, on average, consume too few whole grains and
too many refined grains.13
We oppose allowing flavored low-fat (1 percent) milk for school meals and as a competitive
food. The current standards that allow plain or flavored fat-free milk and plain low-fat milk are
based on expert recommendations from the National Academy of Medicine’s 2009 report.14
 The
recommendations disallowed flavored low-fat milk because it would provide more calories and
likely exceed the calorie maximum for school meals. The 2015 DGA similarly recommended,
“increasing the proportion of dairy intake that is fat-free or low-fat milk” and “reducing the
intake of added sugars” such as those in flavored milk.15
 Similarly, the Robert Wood Johnson
Foundation’s Healthier Beverage Guidelines recommend only plain fat-free and low-fat milk for
children and adolescents.16
Rather than weakening school nutrition, we urge the administration to support school efforts to
continue the progress to improve school food. ",In favor of original HHFKA

Rather than lowering nutrition standards, the USDA should be supporting schools in their efforts to provide healthier meal options.
Today, more than 99 percent of schools participating in the National School Lunch Program meet its nutrition standards, up from 14 percent in 2009-2010.
There are many ways of addressing the issue of food waste without lowering nutritional standards.  Much of the waste can be reduced by changing the way fruits and vegetables are presented and prepared, as well as making sure lunch is served at an appropriate time of day, providing enough time to eat, and having recess before the meal.  
There is even a question whether food waste has increased. Some reports indicate that children are throwing away less of their entrees and vegetables. A 2014 study found that after implementation of the nutrition standards, entre and vegetable consumption increased by about 16 percent.
Rather than lowering the nutrition standards, Wilson said the government should focus on solutions that dont sacrifice childrens health. For example, farm-to-school programs, such as the grant program administered by the USDA, have allowed children to experience hands-on nutrition lessons.  As an Amercorps volunteer, mu daughter was involved in such a program and saw how effective such programs can be in teaching children about nutrition and helping them to change their dietary habits.
Good nutrition is important for high academic achievement.  A 2017 California study found that, on average, children who received healthier school meal options scored better on end-of-year academic tests.

2017,FNS-2017-0021-7412,nan,Constituent,"I am writing to express my disappointment with the USDA's decision to modify the sodium, whole grains, and milk standards in the National School Lunch and School Breakfast Programs. I oppose the changes and urge you to reconsider your decision. Our children need healthy, nutritious foods at school - and these changes are a significant step in the wrong direction, jeopardizing their health, well-being, and academic success.
I am very concerned that the changes will allow schools to serve meals with excess sodium. Children currently eat too much sodium, which can lead to negative health effects, such as elevated or high blood pressure, and an increased risk of developing heart disease at an earlier age. 
I am also concerned that the changes will allow schools to serve fewer whole grains. Whole grains provide nutrients and are a healthful source of fiber. 
Eating whole grains and fiber is associated with increased diet quality and decreased risk of cardiovascular disease, and some studies show that eating them can lower body weight as well. We should be encouraging kids to eat more whole grains - not less.
In addition, allowing schools to serve 1% flavored milk contradicts many expert recommendations and increases the number of calories children consume. 
These changes to the standards not only have negative health effects, but they are also unnecessary. More than 99% of participating schools are already meeting the strong, science-based nutrition standards the Department adopted in 2012. Rather than weakening these standards, USDA should focus on helping those schools that need extra assistance to cross the finish line. For example, USDA should work with schools to ensure that they have the education, training, and equipment necessary to prepare nutritious meals that meet the requirements. 
Healthier children are more likely to become healthier adults. By 2025, the current healthy nutrition standards are estimated to decrease the number of childhood obesity cases by more than two million and lead to a cost savings of $800 million. With our kids developing high blood pressure, diabetes, and other chronic conditions, keeping school nutrition standards strong is more important than ever.

National School Lunch (NSLP) and School Breakfast Programs (SBP). We believe these proposed changes
are not in the best interest of Colorado’s students and that they would undermine the hard work
Colorado’s schools are already doing to improve their meal programs.
Over the course of the last several years, Colorado schools have worked diligently to provide healthier
meals to students in order to help improve the health of children, to help fight hunger, and to reduce
childhood obesity. In Colorado, nearly 400,000 students participate in school meal programs, and this
number has been steadily growing each year. As in many states across the nation, hunger and
childhood obesity are major concerns for Colorado. More than 80 percent of children that participate in
the National School Lunch and School Breakfast programs in Colorado receive them for free or at a
reduced price. For these low income students, school meals are often a primary source of balanced
nutrition. Strong standards for the quality of these meals are essential to ensuring that Colorado’s
children are hunger-free and healthy.
Many children consume up to half of their daily calories during the school day, giving our nation’s
schools an important role in the fight against childhood obesity and hunger. Limiting the amount of
calories children consume daily through flavored milk, eliminating unnecessary added sodium, and
encouraging the consumption of whole grains are important strides schools are already well on their
way to making to support healthy eating and comprehensive nutrition among their students. School
nutrition directors and staff have already been working hard for several years to comply with federal
nutrition standards, designing menus and food offerings that meet the current guidance. Preserving
these existing rules would provide students with healthy, balanced meals. Changing the rules now, after
years of planning and implementation, would create unnecessary disruption and confusion for schools
and ultimately harm the health of students.
The Colorado Health Foundation is the state’s largest private foundation and works closely with schools
and communities to advance our vision of bringing health within reach for all Coloradans. We strongly 
oppose these proposed changes to school meal programs because we believe they would harm the
health of Colorado’s children and undermine years of hard work that our schools have been doing to
support their students.
We thank you for the opportunity to provide comments and encourage the USDA to continue to provide
thoughtful leadership to improve the nutrition standards for school meals. Colorado students deserve

I am writing to express that I oppose the Food and Nutrition Service, USDA's new Child Nutrition Programs: Flexibilities for Milk, Whole Grains, and Sodium Requirements. These new rules are corporate America friendly but will harm our children in the long run. 
1) Addressing sodium content, we should not be relaxing standards on sodium content in school foods. 1 in 3 Americans will develop High Blood Pressure in their lives...sodium content in prepared food is a HUGE player in this! 
2) The proposal sates the ""USDA believes the food industry will continue efforts to develop more acceptable, affordable products that are appealing to students. Through interaction with industry at multiple food shows, including the National Restaurant Association's Annual Show, USDA has learned that manufacturers are continuing their efforts to expand their product lines for schools. For instance, whole grain-rich pizza crust and different types of breads, such as whole grain-rich pita and flatbread, are now available to schools."" Evidence shows that if you relax regulation then their is no incentive for corporations to make these changes. This is a big mistake. 
3) Lastly, allowing low-fat flavored milk vs fat-free is not a ""negligible difference"" as you claim. On a ""per serving"" basis this may be true for sugar but you need to look at the cumulative effect of this policy would be a tremendous amount. By your own admission your not even sure that having low-fat flavored milk will mean students would choose milk. Not having access to purchase sugary beverages such as as sugar fruit juices, ""sports"" drinks and soda within schools should be a focus as well as having access to other sources of saturated fat such as cheese, nuts, nut butters and non-flavored low-fat milk - these are better alternatives and choices to meet caloric and healthy dietary standards.

Virtually all schools (99 percent) participating in the National School Lunch and Breakfast Programs are making great progress toward serving healthier meals for low-income children with less sodium; more whole grains, fruits, and vegetables; and no trans-fat; and removing sugary drinks and unhealthy snack food.

It is no secret that one out of three American children and adolescents aged 2 to 19 years is overweight or obese.4,5 With that extra weight comes a long list of health problems rarely unheard before in young children, but now all too common. Health problems associated with excess weight in children include: type 2 diabetes, joint pain/malformation, elevated blood lipids, high blood pressure, airway obstruction and low self-esteem. However, what may be surprising is children consume one-third to one-half of daily calories at school 6. Taken into account the amount of days per year children spend at school, it seems obvious The Harvard University T.H. Chan School of Public Health was correct in concluding the update to school nutrition standards is ""one of the most important national obesity prevention policy achievements in recent decades.7 By improving the way children and adolescents eat one-third to one-half of the year, researchers estimate that more than 2 million cases of childhood obesity are prevented and up to $792 million in health-care related costs will be saved over ten years. Thus, these improvements to school nutrition not only reduce childhood obesity, but are projected to save more than they cost to implement. Contrary to supporting schools and children's health, the proposed changes in the IFR could jeopardize this process. Schools are working to provide American children healthier meals with less salt; more whole grains; fruits, and vegetables; and no trans-fat, in addition to removing most soda and junk food from schools. Our administration should support that progress, not roll it back. Rather than weakening school nutrition standards, I urge the administration to support efforts to continue the progress to improve school food. This is the next generation after-all.

2017,FNS-2017-0021-7523,nan,Constituent,"Dear USDA,
I support school efforts to continue to improve school food, rather than allow for delays and less healthy meals as allowed by the new rule.  Please discontinue the interim final rule ""Child Nutrition Programs: Flexibilities for Milk, Whole Grains, and Sodium Requirements"" (IFR) (82 FR 56703).
What the USDA is calling ""flexibility"" in this new rule actually means delays and allowances to provide meals that are less healthy to students rather than following the 2010 Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act that improved nutrition standards for school meals.
 
The 2010 decision to adopt higher nutrition standards reflected years of research presented in reports by a wide range of health and nutrition experts and institutions, including the Harvard University T.H. Chan School of Public Health, the 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans (DGA), the National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine and the 2009 report School Meals: Building Blocks for Healthy Children.
  
I believe the new rule is harmful in the following ways:
Firstly, kids already have too much sodium in their diet, which can lead to high blood pressure and cardiovascular disease later in life (""Sodium Intake among US School-Aged Children: National Health Nutrition Examination Survey, 2011-2012"").  Freezing sodium at 2014 levels in school meals will NOT continue the progress of getting sodium amounts under control and to a healthy level for our kids. 
 
 Secondly, 99% of all schools have implemented the new standards, according to the Food Research and Action Center, so why do we need waivers for food that contains less than 51% whole grain?  This standard is already being met.  Furthermore, whole grain is healthy and important in the diet of our young learners.  Whole grains contain increased vitamins, minerals, and fiber as compared to refined grains.  USDA's MyPlate suggests that Americans make half of our grains whole. 
 
And lastly, it is harmful that school districts are now free to use 1% flavored milk in addition to the previously permitted skim or 1% plain milk & skim flavored milk. While schools are not required to provide the sweetened milk, most do, and the inclusion of sweetened milk has menu planning repercussions beyond the milk itself.  When higher caloric sweetened milk options are provided all students at the school may get less food because some students get significantly more calories from their milk choice.  A student choosing 1% chocolate milk is getting an additional 60 kcal and 12g of added sugar as compared to the student who chooses skim milk. Based on the way that caloric intake is analyzed for USDA compliance to NSLP requirements, this means that a school serving 1% flavored milk must balance the calories within the highest caloric milk against the calories provided within the food, which could shortchange some students real nutrition because of the extra calories being served through the sugar-sweetened flavored milk.  Therefore, NOT serving 1% flavored milk will result in menus that are healthier and serve better food options.
Interestingly, according to the Food Research and Action Center, more students participated on an average day in the free lunch program the year after new nutrition standards were implemented (2013-14) than the year before.  In fact, in 2013-14, more students received free lunches on an average day than any year previously in at least the ten years prior.  So students have been embracing the healthier changes from the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act.
I strongly recommend that you abandon the interim final rule ""Child Nutrition Programs: Flexibilities for Milk, Whole Grains, and Sodium Requirements"" (IFR) (82 FR 56703), and instead follow the school nutrition guidance of the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act for the reasons outlined above.

2017,FNS-2017-0021-7551,nan,Constituent,"RE: CNP Flexibilities for Milk, Whole Grains, and Sodium Requirements
I am opposed to instituting these proposed changes in regard to the school lunch program. I live in a poor, rural community in Hawaii. Over 90% of the students in our local K-12 school are eligible for free school lunches and for a significant number of them, a school lunch will be their main meal of the day, and likely, the most balanced and nutritious one they will have. 
The 50% whole grain requirement is important because students' diets more often include refined grains because they are cheaper and more readily available. School lunches should be educational for students in terms of the components of a healthy meal. It's also important that while they are young, children experience the taste and texture of a healthy meal. That way, there is a chance they choose a healthy diet as they age and avoid the consequences of bad nutrition choices such as diabetes, heart disease, dental decay, obesity, etc.
In regard to salt, keeping it as low as possible in school lunches is important since salt is ubiquitous in processed foods, a diet staple in most families. Therefore, school lunches should aim to keep salt as low as possible since the salt content in student's diets outside of school cannot be controlled.
Lastly, given the rates of dental decay and obesity in children, especially low-income children, sugary-flavored milk should not be allowed. This is sending a completely harmful message to children: something good for you like milk, is also sweet. 
We have made a concerted effort in our school to offer healthy meals to children and indications are they like it! Why go backwards to give cafeterias the cheaper option of processed grains, higher salt, and sugary milk? The school lunch program must set the standard for healthy choices not tear it down. If the school lunch program were better funded, I don't believe schools would want to lower standards. They might want more flexibility in regard to selection of healthy foods!
Since good nutrition is so closely tied to readiness to learn, it is vital we opt for the healthiest menus possible!

2017,FNS-2017-0021-7581,nan,School,"The Council of the Great City Schools, the coalition of the nation’s largest central
city school districts, submits the following comments in support of the interim final
rule published in the Federal Register on November 30, 2017 providing flexibility in
school meal requirements for sodium, whole grains, and low-fat milk. The Council
recommended similar flexibilities in our original April 2011 comments to the
Department of Agriculture. This interim final rule now provides an additional year of
operational stability for school-meal programs during school year 2018-19, rather
than waiting for flexibility to be extended annually by Congress.
While the Council appreciates the flexibility provided to school meal programs under
the interim rule, these regulatory revisions should be made permanent. Moreover,
there are other regulatory revisions in the school meal programs that are needed as
well. Ever since the passage of the Healthy and Hunger-Free Kids Act (HHFKA), the
Council has repeatedly highlighted the overly prescriptive, costly, and unnecessary
regulatory requirements imposed on the National School Lunch Program (NSLP) and
the School Breakfast Program (SBP).
To be clear, the Council has been on record as unequivocally opposing the sale of
junk food in our schools, and supporting the current nutrient and dietary requirements
for school meals -- except for the widely-criticized and congressionally-suspended
sodium requirements. Nonetheless, the Council has long-contended that the
Department’s meal pattern regulations represent unwarranted federal
micromanagement of school meal programs [7 CFR 210.10(c) and 220.8(c)]. These
regulations add over $1 billion in annual unreimbursed costs to school meals, and
have complicated the ability of school nutritionists and food service staff to provide
attractive food options for students.With the Great City Schools already meeting the current nutrition and dietary requirements of the
regulations, the Council sees little justification for continuing to impose prescriptive federal
requirements on the type, volume, frequency, form, and even the color of food items in our
school cafeterias [7 CFR 210.10(c) and 220.8(c)]. The Council is puzzled as to why the
Department has been regulating exhaustive details on food items being served to school children
each week, particularly when some food items (e.g., dark green vegetables versus orange and red
vegetables) are higher in nutrient value. In fact, the Department prohibited nutrient-based meal
plans under the HHFKA regulations – previously used in nearly a third of the nation’s schools to
meet the nutrient and dietary requirements of the Act -- in favor of mandating the food-specific
meal patterns in the current federal regulations.
In contrast, regulatory reform in the school lunch and breakfast programs could allow schools to
take better advantage of in-season fruits and vegetables, design more desirable meals, reduce
plate waste, increase student participation, accommodate cultural needs, and control costs. At a
minimum, variations and substitutions at the cafeteria level – beyond merely meat alternatives –
are warranted, and should be reconsidered by the Department even though rebuffed during the
initial HHFKA comment process. In addition, the one-size-fits-all age/grade-span regulations
adopted by the Department ignore the operational realities of multiple grade span configurations
(e.g., K-8 or K-12) in many school districts that depart from the traditional elementary, middle,
and high school framework [7 CFR 210.10(c)(1)] and 220.8(c)(1)].
Not only have the federal school meal regulations increased local operational costs, but the “a la
carte entrée” restrictions have reduced our normal local cafeteria revenue by prohibiting the sale
of otherwise nutritionally-approved entrees as cafeteria items on successive days [7 CFR
210.11(c)(3), also 220.12].
Increasing our costs, providing insufficient federal reimbursements, micromanaging our menus,
and restricting our local cafeteria revenue has resulted in a multi-year regulatory burden that
demands reform. The Council strongly encourages the Department to reopen the meal pattern
and a la carte entrée regulations in these two school meal programs for public comment and
revision through an accelerated notice and comment period. Please contact us at 202-393-2427

2017,FNS-2017-0021-7583,nan,Constituent,"I object to the proposed lowering of standards of school lunches that feed our nation's neediest children. Keeping whole grain foods, lowering sodium levels and avoiding sugary drinks are all vital for the health of our kids. 
I would know. I struggled with childhood obesity and unhealthy lunch options didn't help me one bit. As a kid, if the unhealthy options were offered, that's what I went for. So did most other people--even the sports kids. I remember in high school, kids would get whole plates of french fries or slices of pizza even if salads or a better main option was offered. In elementary school, everyone bought lunch on waffle day--and coated them in tons of sticky syrup. That was all most of us ate for lunch that day too. Why would we bother making a healthy choice when pizza or a plate of fries was cheaper and tasted better? Why would we bring lunch when we could have junk? High school or elementary, we were still kids. 
That's not even considering food with hidden health costs, like non-whole grain or high sodium content. How can you make the right choice if you don't even know what the right choice is? 
Plus, this situation only gets worse the more reliant you are on school lunches and the younger you are. If you can't even choose the healthy option, you're stuck with whatever bad food your school gives you. I was lucky that I had a choice. So many other kids aren't.
Bad nutrition options in school have a lasting impact. I still struggle with making healthy choices and I'm an adult. The fact that bad food was easier, cheaper and there was lots of it has only made that struggle harder. Again, at least I had a choice--not everyone has that luxury.

The Harvard University T.H. Chan School of Public Health concluded that the update to school
nutrition standards is “one of the most important national obesity prevention policy achievements
in recent decades.”4 Researchers estimate that these improvements prevent more than 2 million
cases of childhood obesity and save up to $792 million in health-care related costs over ten years.
Improved school nutrition is critical given that one out of three children and adolescents aged 2 to
19 years is overweight or obese5,6 and children consume one-third to one-half of daily calories during the school day.7 Contrary to supporting schools and children’s health, the proposed
changes in the IFR could jeopardize this progress.
The three-year delay in the second sodium reduction levels would harm children’s health
We oppose the proposed three-year delay (from School Year 2017-2018 to School Year 2021-2022)
of the second sodium reduction targets (Target 2) for school meals that would lock in unsafe levels
of sodium for children. Unfortunately, nine out of ten children consume too much sodium,8
increasing their risk of high blood pressure, heart disease, and stroke.9 Many schools, food service
companies, and others in industry are working toward or already providing healthy and appealing
meals and products with less sodium. USDA should address remaining challenges through training
and technical assistance. Delaying the second phase of sodium reduction puts children’s health at
risk and would result in children consuming an extra 84 to 98 teaspoons of salt (over the course of
the three-year delay).10 Further, we are opposed to any delay of the third and final phase of
sodium reduction for school meals (Target 3 which is supposed to go into effect School Year 2022-
2023).
Continuing the whole-grains waiver is unnecessary
There is no need to continue the whole-grain waivers. USDA concedes in the IFR that 85 percent of
schools have not requested waivers and are providing children with appealing whole-grain options.
If all schools in Alabama, Idaho, and Montana can serve whole grains to their students, schools in
the rest of the states should be able to as well.11 Eating more whole grains is associated with
reduced risk of heart disease, stroke, and diabetes, provides more nutrients, and are a healthful

We oppose weakening school nutrition standards, and instead urge USDA to both maintain the
standards and invest in resources and supports to help schools meet these standards and further
get students excited about eating healthy meals. These supports should include training and
technical assistance to help the few districts that find it challenging to implement the standards.
USDA should also continue to invest in school-based nutrition education to get students excited
about healthy school meals. School-based nutrition education can maximize the investment we
are making in nutritious school meals, and is proven to increase students’ attitudes towards and
consumption of school meals. Team Nutrition, SNAP-Education, and the Farm to School
program are all USDA initiatives that can give students the knowledge, skills, and motivation to
eat well in school and support the school nutrition standards. USDA should focus on investing in
these initiatives instead of taking steps backwards by weakening standards.

We oppose allowing flavored low-fat (1 percent) milk for school meals and as a competitive
food. The current standards that allow plain or flavored fat-free milk and plain low-fat milk are
based on expert recommendations from the National Academy of Medicine’s 2009 report.
14 The
recommendations disallowed flavored low-fat milk because it would provide more calories and
likely exceed the calorie maximum for school meals. The 2015 DGA similarly recommended,
“increasing the proportion of dairy intake that is fat-free or low-fat milk” and “reducing the
intake of added sugars” such as those in flavored milk.15 Similarly, the Robert Wood Johnson
Foundation’s Healthier Beverage Guidelines recommend only plain fat-free and low-fat milk for
children and adolescents.

Conclusion
We oppose further delay of the sodium reduction targets (both Target 2 and Target 3), the
continuation of the whole-grains waiver, and allowing flavored low-fat milk. Rather than
weakening school nutrition standards, we urge the administration to support efforts to continue
the progress to improve school food.

2017,FNS-2017-0021-7653,nan,Advocacy,"On behalf of the Healthi Kids Coalition, an initiative of Common Ground Health, we welcome an
opportunity to comment on the Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) interim final rule: Child Nutrition
Programs: Flexibilities for Milk, Whole Grains and Sodium. The Healthi Kids Coalition is a grassroots
community coalition of over 460 volunteers and community organizations. Our coalition is comprised of
pediatricians, child care providers, registered dietitians, healthcare professionals, the local food bank,
local nonprofit groups, residents and parents who advocate for healthier, more active kids in Monroe
County, New York.
Studies from the Center on the Developing Child at Harvard University and the U.S. Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention demonstrates that good nutrition is the foundation for learning and children’s
optimal growth and development. The NSLP makes it possible for children across the country to receive
healthy meals at school every day. For the last ten years, the Healthi Kids Coalition has been working
with the Rochester City School District (RCSD) to advance healthier school meals. The Healthi Kids
Coalition strongly supports maintaining the current, evidence-based nutrition standards as set
through the Healthy Hunger-Free Kids Act (HHFKA).
Current school meal standards improve food security in the City of Rochester:
The Healthi Kids Coalition strongly supports the current nutrition standards as identified in the HHFKA
to ensure all kids, regardless of income, have access to high quality and nutritious meals. Studies
indicate food insecurity has a negative impact on children’s physical, social-emotional and cognitive
development, and inhibits a child’s ability to learn. In the City of Rochester, the rate of childhood
poverty is alarming:
• Over 50 percent of children in the City of Rochester live in poverty
• 83 percent of children are eligible for free or reduced-price lunches
Often the only meals students have throughout the week are during school hours through federal meal
programs. It is critical the meals provided to our students continue to be healthy and consistent with the
Dietary Guidelines for Americans and the American Heart Association guidelines that include reducing
sodium, added sugar and eating 100 percent whole grain rich foods.As one of the primary sources of nutrition for millions of children, federal school meal programs should
seek every opportunity to limit added sugars. Children should be encouraged to choose healthy
beverages including low-fat milk without added sugar and water.
Current school meal standards improve health outcomes:
Ensuring healthier school meal standards in schools across the country is critical. The Healthi Kids
Coalition is concerned the proposed changes in the interim final rule will impact the overall progress
made to reduce childhood obesity across the country. Research from the American Academy of
Pediatrics indicates childhood obesity is responsible for $14 billion in direct medical costs. In the City of
Rochester, childhood overweight and obesity have emerged as a public health crisis:
• 1 in 3 children are overweight or obese
• 38.2 percent for African American children; 46.6 percent for Latino children; and 37.7
percent for Caucasian children
Student participation in school meals programs reduces poor health outcomes, obesity and food
insecurity. To reduce the long term economic impact of childhood obesity, it is critical schools continue
to serve high quality, nutritious meals to children. Research from the PEW Charitable Trusts shows that
the standards set by the HHFKA are improving overall nutrition habits, and students of all ages are
choosing more nutritious lunches and consuming more of their entrees. These results echo local
research conducted by Healthi Kids and Children’s Institute that analyzed student preference and waste
of school meals in the RCSD:
• 68 percent of students eat most of their entrees at lunch
• 76 percent of students drank all or most of their milk
• 77 percent of children consumed their selected fruit
The current school meal standards are providing a supportive environment for children and are leading
to improved dietary habits and positive attitudes towards eating healthy and exercise.
The current school meal standards work:
The current nutrition standards set in the HHFKA work. Since 2012, the Rochester City School District
has continued to successfully meet and exceed current nutrition requirements. Our local research
demonstrates the current standards are effective:
• Two-thirds of all students surveyed indicated they enjoyed the food served
• 50 percent of students shared they would like more variety in their meals, healthier choices,
and additional vegetables and fruit options
• 23 percent of children identified they would like more fruits and vegetables
• 22 percent of children identified they would like additional seasoning and fresher quality
ingredients
To meet the current standards RCSD and the Healthi Kids Coalition have piloted many successful, lowcost and innovative programs including:
• Salad bars and flavor stations that permit kids to customize their meal with low sodium
flavor options
• Improving marketing of healthier options
• Establishing youth and teen school food advisory councils
• Training food service professionalsIn the future we will continue to work alongside our local district to pilot these and other initiatives like
Farm to School that enhance school meal quality. School districts across the country can replicate the
success of the RCSD Food and Nutrition Service to meet the current HHFKA standards.
The flexibilities provided in the interim rule threaten the progress that has been made to date. Every
child, regardless of their socioeconomic status, deserves nutritious school meals that support their
ability to reach their highest potential. The Healthi Kids Coalition strongly encourages the USDA to fully
implement the HHFKA standards in its final rule. It hurts our children and our entire community to
continue rolling back the requirements.

I oppose offering flavored milk because the flavoring is likely to include added sugars and chemical colors and flavors. In simplest terms, it seems like adding sugar, coloring, and flavoring to milk would increase the cost as well as compromise the bottom-line nutritional value so this does not make sense to me. I oppose allowing grains that are not whole-rich because more refined wheat products are stripped of some nutrients as well as fiber. I am opposed to relaxing the sodium requirements because added sodium can lead to health problems as well as obesity by mis-enhancing the taste of food. I support nutrition programs including school nutrition programs that promote healthy eating habits at an early age and sustaining those healthy habits through the teen years which encourages healthy eating into adulthood. Adding sugars, flavors, and colors will add expense to food while adding pounds to our children. Lessening whole grains decreases fibers and natural nutrients.

2017,FNS-2017-0021-7668,nan,Constituent,"Dear USDA,
I'm concerned about a few elements of the USDA School Meals Rule. Childhood obesity and other nutrition-related health problems are rampant in the USA. Eating whole grains and a diet low in added sugars and sodium are critical elements of a healthy lifestyle that promotes longevity. 
The current proposed rule would continue to exempt certain products from meeting whole grain standards. USDA should be helping schools to serve tasty whole grain foods, not making exemptions to give kids unhealthy foods.
The rule would also freeze sodium limits instead of moving forward with reduced sodium targets. High sodium intake is associated with hypertension and other negative health impacts. USDA has a responsibility to promote healthy eating, not adding to our health crisis.
Lastly, for those able to drink it, milk is a healthy source of calcium and other vitamins. Currently, flavored milk is not allowed because of high sugar and fat content. This rule should remain in place and not be removed.
USDA would do well to investigate the results of National Geographic's Blue Zones study and project. Nutritious diet is a critical component to a long and healthy life, as evidenced by a global study covering thousands of people. The Blue Zones Project is now in many US communities, including in many towns in Iowa, where it has had positive effects on health. Elements of this study and effects in US communities should inform the School Meals Rule, not money from corporate interests.",In favor of original HHFKA
2017,FNS-2017-0021-7673,nan,Advocacy,"On behalf of the Food Research & Action Center (FRAC), please accept these comments
on the “Child Nutrition Programs: Flexibilities for Milk, Whole Grains, and Sodium
Requirements,” 82 Fed. Reg. 56703 (November 30, 2017).
FRAC believes the healthier school meal rules that have taken effect have been an
important step for our nation to remedy nutritional shortfalls in children’s diets and to
help address the current high rates of obesity and chronic disease. We want the best
nutrition for all children, particularly low-income children, who may lack access to
consistent healthy, quality food outside of school.
The improved USDA nutrition standards for school meals are extraordinarily important
for the health and academic success of America’s school children. Thirty million children
eat lunch at school every day; more than 21 million of them are low-income children
whose families are struggling to make ends meet. Nearly 15 million (12 million of them
low-income) eat school breakfast every day. Research shows that the new standards have
a positive impact on the school nutrition environment, as well as student food selection
and consumption, especially for fruits and vegetables.
FRAC is concerned about the proposed changes to the school nutrition standards, and
strongly supports maintaining the current, evidence-based school meal program standards
to assure that all children have access to foods that support their health, well-being, and
learning, irrespective of the school they attend.
School meals should be consistent with the Dietary Guidelines for Americans, including
serving whole-grain foods and limiting sodium and saturated fat. This is especially
important because most American children do not consume enough fiber and whole
grains, and consume too much sodium and fat. The majority of schools are fully and
successfully meeting the current nutrition requirements already; this is not a time for
rolling back the standards.
2
The improvements to school meals are especially important for low-income children who
are vulnerable to obesity and poor nutrition because of risk factors associated with
poverty, including limited resources, limited access to healthy and affordable foods,
fewer opportunities for physical activity, high levels of stress, greater exposure to
obesity-related marketing, and limited access to health care. Given all of these
challenges, school meal programs play an important role in improving the health of lowincome children.
To ensure that children get the full value from the new healthier school meals, FRAC
offers these recommendations to enhance the positive impact of the school nutrition
programs:
• ensure that students who are eligible for free and reduced-price school meals are
being certified, by working with states to improve and strengthen direct
certification systems and address any barriers in the school meal application
process;
• encourage eligible schools to offer free breakfast and lunch to all students through
the Community Eligibility Provision, and any other federal universal provisions
that are available to schools; and
• promote breakfast in the classroom and other alternative school breakfast models.
FRAC encourages USDA to continue its excellent nutrition education (e.g., Team
Nutrition), program technical assistance training, and education initiatives.
Child and Adult Care Food Program (CACFP)
The current requirement that flavored milk be fat free seems to be generally well?
accepted by CACFP program operators. The current CACFP fat-free standard for
flavored milk is consistent with the school meals standard, helping to ensure product
availability, and simplifying menu planning for schools and others using both programs.
In addition, FRAC commends USDA for continuing to prohibit flavored milk for
children five years of age and younger.
Congressional Interference
FRAC appreciates the opportunity to comment on the proposed changes to the nutrition
standards, as well the opportunity to comment on the nutrition standards when they were
first proposed. We believe that the nutrition standards should be based on science and are
too important to our children’s health to be politicized. We believe continued
congressional interference in the implementation of the healthy school meals standards
threatens harm to children’s health. Having members of Congress micromanage nutrition
policy undermines the process of expert evidence-based review and recommendations,
holds progress back, creates practical problems around menu planning and food
procurement, and causes frequent shifts in policy unrelated to the science.

In summary, FRAC is concerned about proposed revisions to the school meal standards.
Our nation’s children need and deserve strong, evidence-based nutrition standards that
support their learning, health, and well-being. ",In favor of original HHFKA

With the health and well-being of my community and our country in mind, I strongly oppose weakening school nutrition standards. 
I work on a program in San Francisco to help child care providers foster an environment in which the healthy choice is the easy choice and all preschoolers develop healthy habits for life. Weakening school nutrition standards will undermine this effort and make unhealthy choices abound again in schools. There is no scientific basis for weakening standards. With over 98% compliance nationwide, it's clear that there is no need to weaken standards. The 2012 updates to school nutrition standards reflect sound science, support children's health, and are consistent with the 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans (DGA)  and the National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine (formerly, Institute of Medicine) 2009 report School Meals: Building Blocks for Healthy Children.

Virtually all schools (99 percent) participating in the National School Lunch and Breakfast
Programs are making great progress toward serving healthier meals for low-income children with
less sodium; more whole grains, fruits, and vegetables; and no trans fat; and removing sugary
drinks and unhealthy snack food.1

The Harvard University T.H. Chan School of Public Health concluded that the update to school
nutrition standards is “one of the most important national obesity prevention policy achievements
in recent decades.”4
 Researchers estimate that these improvements prevent more than 2 million
cases of childhood obesity and save up to $792 million in health-care related costs over ten
years. Improved school nutrition is critical given that one out of three children and adolescents
aged 2 to 19 years is overweight or obese5,6
and children consume one-third to one-half of daily
calories during the school day.7 Contrary to supporting schools and children’s health, the
proposed changes in the IFR could jeopardize this progress.
The three-year delay in the second sodium reduction levels would harm children’s health
We oppose the proposed three-year delay (from School Year 2017-2018 to School Year 2021-
2022) of the second sodium reduction targets (Target 2) for school meals that would lock in
unsafe levels of sodium for children. Unfortunately, nine out of ten children consume too much
sodium,
8
increasing their risk of high blood pressure, heart disease, and stroke.9
 Many schools,
food service companies, and others in industry are working toward or already providing healthy
and appealing meals and products with less sodium. USDA should address remaining challengesthrough training and technical assistance. Delaying the second phase of sodium reduction puts
children’s health at risk and would result in children consuming an extra 84 to 98 teaspoons of
salt (over the course of the three-year delay).10
 Further, we are opposed to any delay of the third
and final phase of sodium reduction for school meals (Target 3 which is supposed to go into
effect School Year 2022-2023).
Continuing the whole-grains waiver is unnecessary
There is no need to continue the whole-grain waivers. USDA concedes in the IFR that 85
percent of schools have not requested waivers and are providing children with appealing wholegrain options. If all schools in Alabama, Idaho, and Montana can serve whole grains to their
students, schools in the rest of the states should be able to as well.11
 Eating more whole grains is
associated with reduced risk of heart disease, stroke, and diabetes, provides more nutrients, and
are a healthful source of fiber.12
 Children, on average, consume too few whole grains and too
many refined grains.13
Allowing flavored low-fat milk is inconsistent with expert dietary advice and school needs
We oppose allowing flavored low-fat (1 percent) milk for school meals and as a competitive
food. The current standards that allow plain or flavored fat-free milk and plain low-fat milk are
based on expert recommendations from the National Academy of Medicine’s 2009 report.
14 The
recommendations disallowed flavored low-fat milk because it would provide more calories and
likely exceed the calorie maximum for school meals. The 2015 DGA similarly recommended,
“increasing the proportion of dairy intake that is fat-free or low-fat milk” and “reducing the
intake of added sugars” such as those in flavored milk.15 Similarly, the Robert Wood Johnson
Foundation’s Healthier Beverage Guidelines recommend only plain fat-free and low-fat milk for
children and adolescents.
16
Further, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation panel recommended that if schools offered
flavored low-fat milk, it should be no more than 130 calories per 8 ounces. If USDA allows
flavored low-fat milk, I recommend a calorie cap of no more than 130 calories per 8 ounces,
consistent with the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation’s Healthier Beverage Guidelines.
Conclusion
We oppose further delay of the sodium reduction targets (both Target 2 and Target 3), the
continuation of the whole-grains waiver, and allowing flavored low-fat milk. Rather than
weakening school nutrition standards, we urge the administration to support efforts to continue
the progress to improve school food. ",In favor of original HHFKA

Our children are our future.  Strong healthy children become strong healthy citizens.  It's as simple as that.  
ALL children deserve healthy school meals- meals that follow current nutrition standards based on scientific research.  Research dictates that whole grains are better than others.  Research provides standards on milk  for growing children.  There should be no change to these standards because changes would have negative impacts on the health of our children.
Rolling back the guidelines will not achieve our goals.  Exemptions for meeting whole grain guidelines have been made ever since the guidelines were passed in 2012.  That is more than 5 years.  Instead of continually giving exemptions, why not study the issues and provide support to enable the guidelines to be followed as written?  This is a national problem that needs to be studied and resolved.  Support and work with suppliers.   Then notify them that with that support comes the requirement that standards will be met.
As far as sodium guidelines- The last study, done between 2009- 2012 showed that 92% of our children had sodium levels above acceptable guidelines.  That is not acceptable.  By not insisting that sodium guidelines are met, the USDA allows another generation of children to be subjected to schools meals that do not follow sodium guidelines.  That is not acceptable.

To: USDA Secretary Perdue:
I oppose your proposal to weaken school nutrition. Most schools are making great progress toward serving healthier meals with less salt; more whole grains; fruits, and vegetables; and no artificial trans fat, and removing soda and junk food. We should build on that progress, not stop it.
The three-year delay of the second sodium reduction targets for school meals would lock in unsafe levels of sodium. Many schools and food service companies are working toward or already providing healthy and appealing meals with less salt. Any remaining challenges can be addressed through technical assistance.
Unfortunately, nine out of ten children consume too much salt, increasing their risk of high blood pressure, heart disease, and stroke. Delaying the second phase of sodium reduction from the originally scheduled School Year 2017-2018 to School Year 2021-2022 puts children's health at risk and would result in kids consuming an extra 84 teaspoons of salt (over the course of the three-year delay).
There is also no need to continue the whole-grain waivers. 85 percent of schools are providing kids with appealing and tasty whole-grain options. If all schools in Alabama, Idaho, and Montana can serve whole grains to their students, schools in the rest of the states should be able to as well.
Eating more whole grains is associated with reduced risk of heart disease, stroke, and diabetes, provides more nutrients, and are a healthful source of fiber. Kids on average consume too few whole grains and too many refined grains.
Rather than weakening school nutrition, I urge the administration to support school efforts to continue the progress to improve school food.

National School Program: the milk situation, and the new policy adapted by the USDA to essentially postpone the_x000D_
implementation of new sodium and whole grain requirements._x000D_
Recently, the USDA has moved to allow one percent fat milk to be flavored. I take issue with this, because_x000D_
allowing this flavoring to be added will result in extremely sugary milk. This added sugar flavoring, which in some_x000D_
instances contains just as much sugar as soda, outweighs the positive benefits gained from the milk such as calcium,_x000D_
protein, and vitamin C. I understand that it's important for kids at schools participating in the National School_x000D_
Lunch Program to buy and drink the milk provided to them, and that having it taste bland is not a good way to_x000D_
achieve that goal. However, I think that this could still be achieved without the added sugar flavoring. Instead of_x000D_
adding sugar to lowfat milk, milk with much less sugar and a decent amount of fat could be provided to school_x000D_
cafeterias. Fat, while still not healthy when consumed in large quantities and in certain forms, is much healthier_x000D_
than sugar. It also helps milk taste less bland. In this way, I feel that offering milk with more fat and much less_x000D_
sugar could help entice kids to buy more milk, and adding more sugar to students' diets could be avoided entirely._x000D_
The USDA also postponed the implementation of new requirements for levels of sodium and whole grains in school_x000D_
lunches. While I think that the new regulations to be are definitely a move in the right direction, it disappoints me_x000D_
that, under current policy, schools participating in the National School Lunch Program will be able to do essentially_x000D_
nothing towards accomplishing those goals for the next three years. Even if the discussed regulations are_x000D_
undergoing further evaluation, schools should be working towards meeting those goals over the course of the next_x000D_
three years instead of doing nothing and then being three years behind when they are finally implemented. Maybe_x000D_
some kind of reward should be given to schools who strive to achieve meeting the new requirements for sodium_x000D_

I know it is cheaper to provide the kids with highly processed, over salted, low nutrition food.  But it is much more expensive for our society in the long run.  As any parent knows, you can&#39;t trust a elementary school-age child to make the best nutritional choices. We guide their decisions by limiting their options to what is best for them.  School lunches should do the same.  Low-sodium, whole grain options of processed foods abound in the grocery store. <br/><br/>It is disingenuous to say that we need to reduce or even eliminate the changes that were made to improve our kids&#39; health because of a need to ""increase student participation and meal consumption"". Children, over time, eat what you put in front of them. If you offer them the option of a sugar-filled flavored milk that is what they will prefer. If we continually give them highly processed junk carbs, that is what they will prefer. And if all of their food is heavily laced with unhealthy levels of salt, that is what they will prefer. We need to be the responsible adults and offer them better choices. Then they will become accustomed to eating healthier foods.

I have a Master&rsquo;s degree in Nutritional Science from California State University Chico and am currently completing my internship to become a registered dietitian. I am passionate about helping others with nutrition to improve their health and prevent the onset of chronic diseases. I&rsquo;ve had many years of nutrition education and have experience interning with various nutrition organizations. I am currently interning at a WIC office in Salinas, CA and I am seeing firsthand how impactful nutrition can be on the health of mothers and their children. <br/><br/>It is well known that chronic diseases, such as diabetes and heart disease, are on the rise in the United States. A healthy lifestyle, with good nutrition and exercise, plays a significant role in preventing the onset of these diseases. These positive habits start at a young age. It is vital that children learn early on about a nutritious eating pattern so that they become accustomed to a diet rich in fruit, vegetables, and whole grains. <br/><br/>Children currently are not meeting the USDA Dietary Guideline recommendations for whole grains and are exceeding maximum limits for sodium and added sugars.1 School meals can provide proper nutrition to help children learn, grow and stay healthy. Schools should continue to reduce sodium and added sugars, while increasing whole grain consumption. I am not in agreement with the proposed rule to increase flexibilities on these nutrients. <br/><br/>While some argue that students won&rsquo;t like the taste of the meals, 70% of school staff agreed that students liked the new lunches after the meal standards were updated.2 Food service directors reported an overall positive perception of revised school meal standards.3 A food service director in New York reported that they have had success with vendors and purveyors providing a wide variety of whole grain products.3 In addition, a food service director in California stated students were not less likely to select whole grain items.3<br/><br/>Changes in the school breakfast and lunch programs have not decreased participation either. A 2018 study found that the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act had no negative impact on school meal participation.4 It may take time for students to accept healthier options but continuing with these dietary changes is a step in the right direction. It appears to have minimal impact on student participation and perception and can likely get children closer to meeting the dietary guidelines.

2020,FNS-2020-0038-0194,,School,"Dear Ms. Namian:
Subject: Comments Regarding Proposed Rule
The California Department of Education (CDE) Nutrition Services Division (NSD) appreciates the opportunity to review and comment on the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Food and Nutrition Service proposed rule dated November 25, 2020, titled Restoration of Milk, Whole Grains, and Sodium.
As per our previous comments on this subject, the CDE continues to be in favor of strong nutrition requirements that protect the health of school children and are based on the research. The USDA previously went to great lengths to align the nutrition standards for school meals with the Dietary Guidelines for Americans (DGA) and the National Academy of Sciences; it is imperative that we continue to build on the progress made. Furthermore, it is also the will of Congress, as Congress required in the 2010 Health, Hunger-Free Kids Act that school meals be consistent with the DGA.
Since the implementation of the 2012 meal pattern requirements, California has seen significant improvement in the quality of meals served to children in the Child Nutrition Programs. Their meals have less salt, sugar, and saturated fat, and students eat more vegetables, fruit, and whole grains. As a result, we believe that children have benefited from the updated school meal standards. The CDE NSD does not recommend altering the current standards.
While we applaud the USDA for its intention—providing states and districts with flexibility—we encourage the USDA to stay committed to optimal nutrition. The CDE NSD is providing the following comments:
Milk
In January 2012, a Healthy Beverages law was implemented in California which requires all licensed childcare providers to serve only fat-free or low-fat (1 percent) unsweetened, plain milk to children two years of age or older. The Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act required all school meal programs to serve only fat-free or low-fat (1 percent) unsweetened plain milk or fat-free flavored milk to students. Additionally, the caloric content of low-fat milk is comparable to the caloric content of fat-free flavored milk. Increasing the fat in the flavored milk would not only increase saturated fat, but it would also increase the calories by approximately 40 calories per serving (and 80 calories if consumed at both breakfast and lunch). Given that obesity continues to be an issue in Americans of all ages, adding extra calories and fat to school meal offerings would be counterproductive to obesity prevention efforts. Therefore, the CDE NSD does not support low-fat flavored milk. As nutrition professionals and educators, it is important to set standards that benefit children's health and establish lifelong healthy habits for children.
Whole Grains
It is clear in California that not all schools need flexibility to meet the whole
grain-rich requirements. When the USDA allowed requests for exemptions, California only received 46 exemption requests between School Years 2015–2019 from our over 1,300 local educational agencies. And among these requests, many were able to resolve their issues with technical assistance provided by NSD, which restored their ability to serve whole grain-rich items without the need for a waiver.
Research on school children and food consumption shows that children do not consume enough whole grains, so they are not benefiting from the important nutrients and fiber that whole grains provide. The DGA issued by the Department of Health and Human Services and the USDA encourage Americans to consume half or more of their grains as whole. Requiring all grains to be whole grain-rich achieves this baseline. By allowing only half of the grains to be whole grain-rich, children will fall short of meeting the whole grain intake guidelines. Maximizing whole grain-rich items as part of the meal program ensures that children obtain the important nutrients needed and establishes consumption habits and preferences for whole grains. Therefore, serving whole grains exclusively in the school meal programs is imperative. The CDE NSD recommends keeping the requirement for schools to serve all grains as whole grain-rich, with state discretion to grant exemptions to a limited number of schools that demonstrate hardship.
Sodium
Studies on chronic disease and sodium show a clear relationship between blood pressure and salt intake. Research also shows that high blood pressure responds positively to a reduction in salt intake in children, as it does in adults. Currently, most Americans, including school-age children, consume excessive amounts of sodium. As a result, one of the key recommendations of the DGA focuses on reducing the sodium content of meals. It is important that schools do their part to help our nation’s children lower their overall sodium consumption. When comparing the sodium targets of the school meal requirements, the difference between each target is 55–70 milligrams (mg) for breakfast and 295–340 mg for lunch, depending on the age group (based on the average for a five-day week). Schools that serve meals made from scratch, as is the preference under the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act, should not have a problem meeting these requirements.
Schools serving a combination of meals made from scratch and processed foods are also able to meet the weekly average requirement by being strategic in how and when they offer higher and lower sodium foods. We recognize that some schools that are not equipped for scratch cooking will need to rely on more processed foods. Additionally, given the current environment during COVID-19, schools may need additional time to transition back to providing meals that meet these requirements. For this reason, it seems appropriate to extend the implementation of the target two sodium level for a limited amount of time. This also allows the food industry to continue to develop palatable, lower-sodium products. Finally, we recommend that the USDA offer incentives, such as continued funding for equipment grants and other funding opportunities for training, to support schools in implementing lower sodium options through scratch cooking and other strategies.
The nutrition standards set in place promote a shift towards scratch cooking to provide fresh, quality food, and help children understand how healthy meals should taste and look. Providing permanent flexibility in school meals undermines the progress already made in promoting healthier meals to our nation's students. The CDE NSD urges the USDA to maintain the integrity of the meal program with strong nutrition standards and to partner with states to provide more technical assistance and funding to support schools in offering healthy food options
We owe it to our children to give them a healthy start in life, to teach them about good nutrition, and to show them how to make healthy choices. More than half of California’s school children participate in free or reduced-price meals. Decreasing the nutritional quality of school meals will disproportionally impact children from families with low incomes. These children rely heavily on school meals as their main source of daily nutrition. Changing the nutritional quality of school meals therefore is also an issue of equity, widening existing disparities in diet quality and health.

2020,FNS-2020-0038-0544,,Constituent,"Ms. Namian:<br/><br/>I am writing in response to the USDA&#39;s proposed rule to remove healthy nutrition standards for school meals. So many of our students nationwide depend on school meals and it is essential that these meals be nutritionally balanced. The healthy nutrition standards ensure that children have access to healthy meals that do not have excess amounts of sodium or ultraprocessed foods. We need to maintain and strengthen standards  to support child development and growth by sustaining healthy standards for whole grains and sodium, among others. School meals should be consistent with the Dietary Guidelines for Americans, including serving whole-grains and limiting sodium and fat.<br/><br/>We are currently in a time of health crisis, with the COVID-19 pandemic, more American families than ever are suffering from food insecurity and poor health. School meals are an essential component in ensuring food access and availability for all Americans, particularly those who are lower-income or suffer greater food insecurity for a variety of reasons, such as rurality and others. Our kids need strong, evidence-based nutrition standards that support learning, wellbeing and health. <br/><br/>I strongly oppose this proposal to roll back nutrition standards. <br/><br/>The original healthy school meal standards are  evidence-based and should be supported. Research shows the positive impact of healthy school meal nutrition standards on school food, disparities, and student nutrition-related outcomes.<br/><br/>In addition, the comment period has been cut unreasonably short, particularly during the holidays.

Strengthening school meals nutrition standards honors the work of WIC providers to encourage healthy choices, curb childhood obesity, and improve health outcomes for young children across the country.Instead of rushed, last-minute changes and delays, USDA should double-down on the existing standards and provide the necessary technical assistance to support school meals programs in transitioning toward science-based, nutritious options that will promote positive child health and development.<br/>Sincerely, Luz Diaz, WIC Nutritionist, Erie Family Health Centers",In favor of original HHFKA
2020,FNS-2020-0038-0550,,School,"The National School Lunch Program is a crucial program that often provides students with meals that they otherwise may not be able to get. Of course, the guidelines for this program should offer flexibility in choice so that students are happy eating the meals provided.  However, due to the vast influence these program guidelines have on the nutritional habits of young people, offering fresh nutritious foods that fulfill the USDA Dietary Guideline recommendations should be the priority.  <br/><br/>Instead of changing guidelines to allow less nutritious but more desirable foods to be offered to students there should be a greater effort in providing healthy food options that look and taste good. Students may take some time to accept healthier food options but I believe if higher standards for freshness and preparation were implemented they would willingly adopt new types of food over time.

2020,FNS-2020-0038-0650,,Advocacy,"On behalf of Oldways, a 501(c)3 educational nonprofit dedicated to inspiring people to embrace the healthy and sustainable joys of the old ways of eating, we are writing in opposition to the Restoration of Milk, Whole Grains, and Sodium Flexibilities. Specifically, we strongly oppose rolling back whole grain-rich requirements to only 50% of grain products. <br/><br/>The FNS&#39;s acknowledgment that ""the proposed change would result in some decrease in whole grain-rich offerings, and children may not receive the same level of key nutrients associated with whole grain-rich items"" is a public health risk that we need not accept. We are equally concerned by the reality that ""schools choosing to offer only half of the grain offerings as whole grain-rich will likely reduce the amount of dietary fiber available to children, making it more challenging for schools to meet the DRI-target for dietary fiber for school meals.""<br/><br/>The timing of this proposed rule is also troubling. Given that the National School Lunch Act ""requires that school meals are consistent with the goals of the latest Dietary Guidelines for Americans,"" it is unclear why the FNS would choose to put forth a proposed rule only days before the 2020-2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans are expected to be released to the public. We urge FNS to wait until after the 2020-2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans are released before exploring changes to the school nutrition programs. <br/><br/>According to the interim ï¬nal rule (Child Nutrition Programs: Flexibilities for Milk, Whole Grains, and Sodium Requirements), published on November 30, 2017, fewer than 15% of schools requested waivers for whole grains. The interim ï¬nal rule also noted that &ldquo;the availability of whole grain-rich products through USDA Foods and the commercial market has increased signiï¬cantly since the implementation of the meal standards and continues to progress, providing new and aï¬€ordable options for local operators to integrate into menus.&rdquo; The flexibilities outlined in the current proposed rule run contrary to the widespread evidence of whole grain-rich compliance and acceptance and ignore the majority of the 86,247 public comments opposed to these flexibilities.<br/>Both common sense and the USDA&rsquo;s own reports tell us that healthier school nutrition standards lead to healthier school lunches. According to the School Nutrition and Meal Cost Study,  published by the USDA FNS in April 2019, &ldquo;updated nutrition standards for school meals have had a positive and significant influence on nutritional quality.&rdquo; Specifically, the nutritional score of school lunches &ldquo;increased 41 percent&mdash;from 57.9 to 81.5 out of a possible 100&rdquo; between the 2009-2010 school year and the 2014-2015 school year. <br/><br/>While cost is often cited a perceived barrier to offering healthier lunches, the USDA study found that &ldquo;there was no significant association between revenue as a percentage of reported cost and compliance with updated nutrition standards for NSLP lunches.&rdquo; In fact, there was no significant difference in costs per lunch in schools with more versus less nutritious meals.<br/><br/>The new proposed rule cites lower participation and increased food waste as reasons for backpedaling current nutrition standards. However, the USDA&rsquo;s own data fail to support these widely repeated mischaracterizations. The School Nutrition and Meal Cost Study found that students were significantly more likely to participate in the NSLP in schools that served the healthiest lunches. Further, while the School Nutrition and Meal Cost Study did not compare plate waste before and after the nutrition standards were changed, the study did report that other &ldquo;studies that examined plate waste before and after implementation of the updated nutrition standards found that levels of plate waste were reduced or unchanged.&rdquo; <br/><br/>School lunch offerings have the power to shape students&rsquo; preferences and build healthy habits for the long-term. Studies show that it can take 8-15 exposures to a food before children begin to accept it,  meaning what ends up in the wastebasket today may very well become a dietary staple down the road. We can&rsquo;t help children build healthy habits for the long-term if we&rsquo;re not giving them a chance to try these healthy foods in the first place. Further, widespread evidence indicates that healthier school meals have actually reduced plate waste  without reducing school meal participation  in many districts. <br/>Research consistently demonstrates that repeated exposure to whole grains can shift both food preferences and eating habits in favor of whole grain foods. ,  The FNS is in an extraordinary position to not only help properly fuel children&rsquo;s growing brains and bodies, but also to help nurture students&rsquo; appetites for nutritious food, thereby laying the foundation for lifelong healthy habits.

2020,FNS-2020-0038-0652,,Advocacy,"The Alliance for a Healthier Generation1 respectfully submits comments in response to the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) proposed rule entitled: “Restoration of Milk, Whole Grains, and Sodium Flexibilities” (85 FR 75241). The proposal would reinstitute the changes to the School Breakfast Program (SBP) and National School Lunch Program (NSLP) sodium, whole grains, and flavored milk requirements (83 FR 63775, December 12, 2018). Those changes were widely opposed by the public2 and invalidated by a federal court over a lack of notice on key provisions.3
The importance of healthy school meals has taken on new urgency during the ongoing coronavirus outbreak. Given the severe economic impacts of COVID-19, more children will likely continue to qualify for free or reduced-priced school meals. For many of these children, school breakfast and lunch may be the only nutritious meals they will consume in a day. The percentage of people experiencing food insecurity since the pandemic began has doubled overall and tripled among households with children.4 Improved school nutrition is critical given that one out of three children and adolescents aged 2 to 19 years is overweight or obese5,6 and children can consume one-third to one-half of daily calories during the school day.7 These rollbacks fail to put children’s health first.
Weakening the standards runs contrary to USDA’s 2019 School Nutrition and Meal Cost Study (SNMCS). This study is the first nationally-representative study to assess school meals after HHFKA and found that the nutritional quality of school lunches and breakfasts, measured by the Healthy Eating Index (HEI-2010) scores,8 increased by 41 percent and 44 percent, respectively, between school years 2009-10 and 2014-15.9 The study also found that schools made significant progress on whole grains10 and sodium reduction11; a majority of schools met daily meal components, especially for fruits and vegetables12; schools with healthier meals experienced higher participation rates in the program13; and plate waste remained the same.14 Weakening the standards will also increase disparities in access to healthy foods.
We oppose the proposed seven-year delay (from School Year 2017-2018 to School Year 2024-2025) of the second sodium reduction targets (Target 2) and elimination of the third sodium-reduction targets (Target 3). USDA noted in the 2018 interim final rule (IFR) that first rolled back these standards that they intended to re-evaluate the sodium reduction targets with the release of the 2020-2025 DGA.15 Similarly in this proposed rule, USDA notes that the law, “requires that school meals are consistent with the goals of the latest Dietary Guidelines for Americans (Dietary Guidelines) (emphasis added).” NASEM updated the Dietary Reference Intake (DRI) for sodium in 201916 which will be the basis for sodium recommendations in the upcoming 2020-2025 DGA.17 That report established a Chronic Disease Risk Reduction (CDRR) level for sodium in recognition that exceeding these levels would increase chronic disease risk within a healthy population. NASEM made even stronger sodium recommendations for younger school-aged children than was the case when the 2012 school meal standards were finalized: lowering the limit for sodium from 2,200 mg to 1,800 mg for children aged 9-13 and from 1,900 mg to 1,500 mg for children aged 4-8.18 Therefore, the Department should wait until after the 2020-2025 DGA are issued given its imminent release. 19 The stakes for children’s health could not be higher: nine out of ten children consume too much sodium,20 increasing their risk of high blood pressure, heart disease, and stroke.21 Further, many schools, food service companies, and others in industry have already made healthy and appealing meals and products with less sodium and rolling back these standards will reduce demand for lower-sodium products, making it harder for schools that want to offer lower-sodium products to do so.
We oppose weakening the whole grain standard from 100 percent of grains served being whole grain-rich to only 50 percent. This change is inconsistent with the DGA and does not support children’s health. Eating more whole grains is associated with reduced risk of heart disease, stroke, and diabetes. Whole grains also provide more nutrients and are a healthful source of fiber.22 Children, on average, consume too few whole grains and too many refined grains.23 USDA’s 2018 IFR showed that most schools (85 percent) were meeting the 100 percent whole grain-rich standard.24 Similarly to rolling back sodium standards, rolling back the whole-grain-rich standard will make it harder for schools that want to continue to offer 100 percent whole-grain-rich to do so. Anecdotally, several school foodservice directors have stated that the whole-grain-rich products they were successfully offering are no longer available, and as a result they have been forced to switch to a non-whole-grain-rich option.
We oppose allowing flavored low-fat (1 percent) milk for school meals and as a competitive food. The current standards that allow plain or flavored fat-free milk and plain low-fat milk are based on expert recommendations from the NASEM’s 2009 report.25 Those recommendations disallowed flavored low-fat milk because it would provide more calories and likely exceed the calorie maximum for school meals. The 2015 DGA similarly recommended, “increasing the proportion of dairy intake that is fat-free or low-fat milk” and “reducing the intake of added sugars” such as those in flavored milk.26 Similarly, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation’s Healthier Beverage Guidelines recommend only plain fat-free and low-fat milk for children and adolescents.27 While the calorie ranges for age groups and grade were intended to limit meals with excessive amounts of added sugar, flavored skim milk is the most sugary item in breakfast and lunch28 and flavored low-fat milk will likely exacerbate this trend.
This proposed rule is part of a larger effort to roll back the nutrition standards and weaken the program. Earlier this year, USDA proposed widening the junk food loophole that would allow schools to serve more entrée items as competitive foods without meeting the Smart Snacks standards, reduce the variety of vegetables, and reduce the amount of fruit in breakfast in the classroom, among other problematic changes.29 If those proposed rollbacks go into effect, research estimates the junk food loophole would add approximately 662 mg of sodium and 3 g of saturated fat over three days (or 1103 mg sodium and 5 g saturated fat over a week) on average relative to Smart Snacks limits currently in place.30 Further, a Health Impact Assessment found the additional proposed changes would adversely affect students’ health and academic performance, and that students from low-income families attending schools that are majority Black or Hispanic and in rural neighborhoods are most likely to be impacted by the proposed changes (while this study focused on the 2020 proposed rollbacks, it can also be generally applied to the rollbacks in this proposed rule).31
We are also concerned about the timing of this proposed rule and shortest possible 30-day comment period is problematic. As mentioned earlier, this proposed rule is premature, given the imminent release of the 2020-2025 DGA.32 Because this rule was released before the DGAs, the public and other stakeholders are not able to determine if the proposed changes to the sodium, whole grains, and milk standards are consistent with the latest dietary recommendations. The 30-day comment period may also make it difficult for stakeholders to comment. Many schools and impacted organizations are dealing with COVID-related feeding issues and are not able to devote adequate time to preparing comments. Executive Order 12866 advises that agencies should generally provide, at a minimum, at least 60 days for public comment.33
Conclusion
We oppose delaying Sodium Target 2 and eliminating Sodium Target 3, weakening the whole grain-rich standard from 100 to 50 percent of all grains served, and allowing flavored low-fat milk. These rollbacks are counter to sound science, will harm children’s health, increase disparities, and dissuade industry innovation. Instead of weakening nutrition standards, we urge the administration to provide the technical assistance needed to support schools struggling with meeting the existing standards, and reconsider science-based standards that are consistent with the most recent DGA.

For students who experience food insecurity, free school meals are often the only meals that they can have. Communities of color are disproportionately affected by food insecurity, and many students who are eligible for free or reduced lunches are of color (i.e. Black or Hispanic). If these meals are not nutritious, the health gap will increase between students of color and White students. These flexibilities also directly contradict the USDA&#39;s own 2015-2020 dietary guidelines in reducing the amount of added sugars and sodium. Added sugars can be found in the flavored, low-fat milk that is proposed to be reintroduced. As stated in the 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines, ""nutritional needs should be met primarily from foods."" Calories from sugary beverages, like flavored milk, should be limited. Additionally, allowing schools more time for gradual sodium reduction demonstrates that there is no pressing need to reduce sodium in children&#39;s diets. During today&#39;s COVID-19 pandemic, it is now more important than ever to take care of our health and our children&#39;s health. By requiring that half o the weekly grains in Child Nutrition Programs are whole grain-rich, the USDA is minimizing their responsibility in ensuring that schools serve more than just the minimum amount of whole-grain foods. This is a missed opportunity for the USDA to be able to provide more whole grain-rich foods to children and minimize risks of heart disease, stroke, obesity, and type 2 diabetes. Increased levels of sodium contribute to high blood pressure which can lead to other health conditions. Although the USDA may claim that these flexibilities will encourage children to eat their lunches at school, it seems that the USDA is simply giving up on educating children on how meals can be tasty and healthy at the same time. While it may be difficult to engage children, this is an important moment to teach them about their health and nutrition. If the USDA promises to serve America&#39;s children well, then they must also rise to the occasion of providing healthy meals and educating students. Today, roughly 13.7 million children and adolescents are considered obese, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. This is an absurd number of obese children in one of the most developed countries in the world, and we must ensure that this number does not increase. To reduce this number, students should properly be taught of their foods in schools.

2020,FNS-2020-0038-0765,,Advocacy,"First Focus on Children submits this comments in opposition to the U.S. Department of
Agriculture’s (USDA) proposed rule entitled: “Restoration of Milk, Whole Grains, and Sodium
Flexibilities” (85 FR 75241). The proposal would reinstitute the changes to the School Breakfast
Program (SBP) and National School Lunch Program (NSLP) sodium, whole grains, and flavored
milk requirements (83 FR 63775, December 12, 2018). Those changes were widely opposed by the
public1 and invalidated by a federal court over a lack of notice on key provisions.2
First Focus on Children is a national, bipartisan advocacy organization dedicated to making children
and families the priority in federal budget and policy decisions. As an organization working to
support the healthy development of America’s children, we remain concerned that the weakening of
current standards would have negative consequences for children’s health and future success.
The importance of healthy school meals has taken on new urgency during the ongoing coronavirus
outbreak. With more than 72,000 school closures in the U.S. affecting at least 37 million children,
ensuring students continue to have access to healthy school meals is more critical than ever. This
outbreak and the resulting economic crisis are falling hardest on the most vulnerable among us,
including our nation’s children. It is disrupting every facet of children’s lives and we cannot yet
know all of the negative and long-lasting implications it will have on children’s healthy development
and future success
Thanks to the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010 (HHFKA), school meal, snack, and beverage
standards were updated, access to free school meals was expanded, along with numerous other
important provisions. The HHFKA is widely considered a significant public health success. Schools
have made extraordinary progress toward serving healthier meals with less sodium, more whole
grains, fruits, and vegetables, and removing soda, other sugary drinks, and unhealthy snack foods.
Research shows that the 2012 and 2014 nutrition standards could prevent up to two million cases of
childhood obesity and save up to $792 million in healthcare costs over ten years.3 Another study
found that for children in poverty, the risk of obesity declined substantially each year after
implementation of HHFKA such that obesity prevalence would have been 47 percent higher in
2018 if the nutrition standards had not been updated.4
Weakening these standards runs contrary to USDA’s 2019 School Nutrition and Meal Cost Study
(SNMCS). This study is the first nationally-representative study to assess school meals after HHFKA
and found that the nutritional quality of school lunches and breakfasts, measured by the Healthy
Eating Index (HEI-2010) scores,5 increased by 41 percent and 44 percent, respectively, between
school years 2009-10 and 2014-15.6 The study also found that schools made significant progress on
whole grains7 and sodium reduction8; a majority of schools met daily meal components, especially
for fruits and vegetables9; schools with healthier meals experienced higher participation rates in the
program10; and plate waste remained the same.11
Weakening the standards will increase disparities in healthy food access. Prior to HHFKA, students
in more affluent and large schools were more likely to have access to healthier foods than those in
under resourced and small schools in states with weaker standards than states with stronger
standards.12 The SNMCS found that the nutritional quality of school meals empowered by HHFKA
is the same across socioeconomic status and race and ethnicity.13 Further, few states have policies on
meal standards such as whole grains and flavored milk that would protect children from these
rollbacks.14
The 2012 school nutrition standards are based on sound science and reflect the 2010-2015 Dietary
Guidelines for Americans (DGA),15 which are further confirmed by the 2015-2020 DGA and the
National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine (formerly, Institute of Medicine) 2009
report School Meals: Building Blocks for Healthy Children.16 The Harvard University T.H. Chan
School of Public Health concluded that the 2012 update to school meal standards and the 2013
update to competitive foods is, “one of the most important national obesity prevention policy achievements in recent decades.”17 A 2014 study from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation’s
former Bridging the Gap research program found that among high school students, having fruits
and vegetables available wherever foods were sold in school, and also not having access to whole or
2% milks in school, lowered the odds of being overweight or obese. Attending a school that met at
least three of the five USDA standards also lowered the odds of high school students being
overweight or obesity by 3 percentage points.18
The seven-year delay (from School Year 2017-2018 to School Year 2024-2025) of the second
sodium reduction targets (Target 2) and elimination of the third sodium-reduction targets (Target
3) would harm children’s health
Unfortunately, children on average consume between 2,500 to 4,200 mg of sodium per day, well
over the recommended levels.19 Excess sodium consumption is strongly associated with the
development and worsening of high blood pressure and an increased risk of coronary heart disease,
stroke, heart failure, kidney failure, gastric cancer, and osteoporosis.20 A substantial number of
studies show that as dietary sodium intake rises, so does blood pressure.21 Studies show a link
between high blood pressure in childhood and high blood pressure in adulthood, and high blood
pressure in childhood is linked to early development of heart disease and risk for premature death.22
Of concern, the prevalence of high blood pressure is increasing in American children.23 Already
about one in six children aged 8-17 have raised blood pressure.24 Children are at higher risk of
developing heart disease and elevated blood pressure at earlier ages if they are obese or eat too much
sodium.25 Children who eat higher-sodium diets are about 40 percent more likely to have elevated
blood pressure than children who eat lower-sodium diets.26
The good news is that lowering sodium consumption can have a tremendous impact on public
health. Studies show that reduced sodium intake can lower blood pressure, control hypertension,
and prevent cardiovascular disease.27,28 In addition, lowering sodium consumption, and thereby lowering blood pressure, can reduce medical costs. From 2012 to 2013, high blood pressure cost the
United States an estimated $51.2 billion in direct and indirect costs.29
Along with the DGA, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the World Health
Organization, the American Heart Association, and other experts all recommend limiting sodium
intake to less than 2,300 mg.30 The CDRR level for sodium in children aged 4-8 years and 9-13 years
is even lower, at 1,900 mg and 2,200 mg, respectively.31 At the current levels (Target 1), a high
school lunch has on average 1,420 mg, or about two-thirds a day’s worth.
In anticipation of schools being required to meet the original sodium-reduction targets, companies
have worked hard to reformulate their products. For example, school food company Revolution
Foods already provides school meals that meet the Target 3 sodium levels. Schwan’s Company—the
largest producer of school pizza—produces the pizza for Revolution Foods and has already invested
in the technology and resources to make appealing school pizzas that meet Targets 2 and 3. In
addition, many companies—including Aramark,32 ConAgra Foods,33 Domino’s Pizza (Smart Slice),34
General Mills,35 Kellogg’s,36 Kraft Foods,37 Mars,38 Nestlé,39 PepsiCo,40 and Unilever41—are engaged
in voluntary sodium reduction across their full lines of consumer products, which should aid school
sodium reduction efforts. And we expect industry efforts will soon intensify as the Food and Drug
Administration is preparing to release voluntary sodium reduction targets for processed, packaged,
and restaurant foods. This also complements state and local efforts such as New York City’s
National Salt and Sugar Reduction Initiative42 and CDC’s Sodium Reduction in Communities
Program.43 A variety of methods and technologies are available to help reduce levels of sodium in
many food categories.44
While we are not aware of USDA collecting data on implementation beyond Target 1, we know that
prior to the pandemic, many schools had been working hard and are at or very close to meeting
Target 2 levels. For example, the school meals program in Elbert County Schools, Georgia has done
tremendous work to get their menus down to safe levels of sodium. They have employed tactics
such as training staff to analyze sodium content in their menus; educating students on nutrition and
menu changes; working with local and regional companies to find alternative products that met their
sodium needs; and re-working their recipes to keep their foods with less sodium appealing to
students.45 Other schools have also lowered sodium by using spice bars and salad bars that gives
students more options to provide flavor with less salt. Schools all around the country—from
Virginia to California, Indiana to Kansas, Oklahoma to New York, and Georgia to North Dakota—
have successfully used these best practices to meet the Target 1 and Target 2 sodium levels. USDA
should put greater effort into elevating and sharing these methods and encouraging their adoption
by other schools around the country.
USDA programs like “Team Up for School Nutrition Success” and the “What's Shaking?” initiative
have been beneficial, but USDA has not kept these programs active. Congress has recognized the
need to provide dedicated technical assistance on sodium reduction for schools and included $1
million in the House FY202046 and FY202147 Agriculture Appropriations bills (the funding was not
included in the FY2020 final spending bill and at the time of this writing FY2021 is still being
negotiated). USDA needs to focus on targeted technical assistance that delivers more intensive and
personalized training for those programs that may still have difficulties lowering sodium. In addition,
the USDA Foods (commodities) program has set a good example for schools by providing more
moderate-sodium options and that work should continue.
Weakening the whole grain-rich standard would harm children’s health
The 2015 DGA recommends making at least half of all grains whole grain.48 Children aged 4 to 18
do not meet the recommended intake for whole grains and exceed the recommended limit for
refined grains.49 Eating more whole grains is associated with reduced risk of heart disease, stroke,
and diabetes, provides more nutrients, and are a healthful source of fiber. 50
Prior to the 2018 rollbacks, whole grain-rich products were widely prevalent in the marketplace. In
December 2017, the Alliance for a Healthier Generation’s Smart Food Planner, an online database
that featured food and beverage products that align with the school nutrition standards, showed that
approximately 874 whole grain-rich products were currently available for purchase by schools (the Alliance no longer maintains this database).51 Further, USDA Foods provides more whole grain
products and has developed a number of resources that list whole grain-rich options.52
Many schools across the U.S. are offering whole grain-rich products on their menus that students
enjoy. Successful strategies for encouraging students to eat more whole grains include student
surveys, samples and taste tests, experimenting with new products and recipes, and peer-to-peer
sharing of food preparation techniques. These techniques have also been successful in sodium
reduction efforts.
USDA had noted in the 2018 IFR that 85 percent of schools had not requested waivers and are
providing children with appealing whole grain options. Some states did not have any schools
requesting waivers such as Alabama, Idaho, and Montana, and others did not allow waivers such as
Arkansas, Maryland, and Rhode Island.53 Some states had multiple waivers for only one type of
product (e.g., pasta) like South Dakota, while North Dakota does not. If the vast majority of schools
can provide whole grain-rich options, the rest should be able to as well. We encourage USDA to
instead provide additional training and technical assistance to school districts that currently are
asking for waivers and are having difficulty meeting the whole grain-rich requirement.
Allowing flavored low-fat (1%) milk is inconsistent with expert dietary advice and school needs
Allowing schools to serve flavored low-fat milk would be inconsistent with expert nutrition
recommendations based on the National Academy of Medicine’s 2009 report54 and the 2015 DGA.55
Similarly, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation’s Healthier Beverage Guidelines recommend only
plain fat-free and low-fat milk for children and adolescents.56
According to USDA’s report Special Nutrition Program Operations Study School Year 2013-2014,
only 13 percent of school food authorities (SFAs) found the milk standards challenging overall—this
rate was the second lowest reported for any food category.57 For breakfast, the rate was even lower,
at six percent—the lowest reported among all challenges.58 When the new milk requirements went
into effect, 75 percent of SFAs stated that they did not observe any change in the amount of milk
wasted, suggesting that student acceptance was not a problem.59 Further, roughly one in five SFAs
reported choosing milk as the item to offer students who requested more food on the lunch line,
showing that it remains an appealing beverage option for students.60 Finally, virtually all SFAs (more
than 90 percent) have employed strategies to encourage milk consumption, such as displaying plain
milk in all-milk coolers, having plain milk account for at least one-third of the drinks displayed in
each cooler, and placing plain milk in front of or before flavored milk or other sugary beverages.61
USDA should encourage these strategies and address any remaining challenges for the few SFAs
through training and technical assistance.
Conclusion
This pandemic will do more than expose the disparities existing in our society — it will compound
those disparities. Child food insecurity remained high in the United States before COVID-19, with 1
in 7 children (11.2 million) living in a household that struggled to put food on the table. Now with
school closures leading to limited access to school meals and low-income household budgets being
stretched even thinner, more children are experiencing, or are at-risk of experiencing, hunger and
food insecurity.
School nutrition staff around the country are working tirelessly to deliver nutritious meals to
children who are out of school. Access to healthy school meals is now more important than ever, for
it may be the only nourishing food that children are able to receive. A healthy childhood with access
to nutritious food is just as important for children as it is for kids to learn to read and write. We
must do better by our children in these scary and urgent times as well as in the future.
Children are a quarter of our population but our entire future. Yet we fail to prioritize them time and
again. Let’s take a step in reversing this trend by maintaining school meal nutrition standards that
ensure that all children can access the nutritious food they need to grow and thrive.

2020,FNS-2020-0038-0770,,Advocacy,"Dear Secretary Perdue:
The Bipartisan Policy Center appreciates the opportunity to submit comments on the proposed changes to the sodium, whole grain, and flavored milk requirements in the National School Lunch Program (NSLP) and School Breakfast Program. We recognize the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA)’s intent to provide school nutrition operators with operational flexibilities; however, we are concerned that these changes are at the expense of children’s health. As a result, we do not support the proposed changes to the milk, whole grain, and sodium requirements.
By law, all federal nutrition policies and programs must promote and support the most recent edition of the Dietary Guidelines for Americans (DGA), which provides evidence-based dietary recommendations for improved health. The 2020-2025 DGA is expected to be released imminently. We ask that USDA not move forward with finalizing this rulemaking until after the 2020-2025 DGA is released and align nutrition standards for the NSLP and the SBP with the 2020-2025 DGA. It is imperative for children’s long-term health that the school nutrition standards align with the latest evidence. The proposed changes to the nutrition standards do not align with the evidence as presented in the current (2015-2020) DGA or the 2020-2025 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee’s scientific report, which summarizes the current state of the science and is intended to be used in the development of the 2020-2025 DGA.
BPC has several concerns with the proposed changes to the milk, sodium, and whole grain requirements in the NSLP and SBP, which taken together, reduce the nutritional quality of the school meals. In short, we ask the Department:
• Implement the second sodium-reduction target and preserve the third sodium-reduction target.
• Protect the whole grain standard from 100-percent whole grain to 50-percent.
• Maintain the current milk requirements around flavored low-fat milk.
Founded in 2007 by former U.S. Senate Majority Leaders Howard Baker, Tom Daschle, Bob Dole, and George Mitchell, BPC is a non-profit organization that combines the best ideas from both parties to promote health, security, and opportunity for all Americans.
These BPC staff-developed comments reflect staff expertise and input from BPC leaders, experts, and stakeholders across nutrition, agriculture, public health, and health care. They do not represent official positions of BPC’s founders or Board of Directors.
Background
BPC’s health program prioritizes bipartisan solutions that improve health outcomes, including access to nutritious food for Americans of all ages. BPC has been actively engaged in school nutrition policy, as it can influence the eating habits of millions of American children, and subsequently their health and costs to the health care system Our 2012 report, Lots to Lose, included recommendations to promote nutritious school meals including advising USDA to ensure its nutrition assistance programs, such as the NSLP and SBP, reflect and support the DGA. It also recommended that schools improve food and nutrition education by aggressively implementing the Healthy Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010 (HHFKA), which reauthorized the child nutrition programs and required that nutrition standards for school foods be updated.1 BPC continued to support advancements in nutrition standards with comments that applauded USDA’s proposed changes to update the meal pattern for the Child and Adult Care Food Program (CACFP) in 2017. Earlier this year, BPC expressed concern with the proposed changes to meal service and monitoring requirements and their potential impact on children’s health. BPC looks forward to working with the 117th Congress and new Administration to reauthorize and strengthen child nutrition programs.
Concerns with Rollbacks to School Meal Standards
The COVID-19 outbreak and its resulting economic consequences has further emphasized the need for healthy school meals. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, most U.S. children consumed as much as half of their daily calories at school prior to the pandemic.2 During COVID-19, many families experienced income loss, which made it more difficult to put food on the table. As a result, more children have become reliant on free school meals. In fact, the percentage of people experiencing food insecurity has tripled in households with children.3
Racial disparities in food insecurity have also deepened as a result of COVID-19. In July, the Food Research & Action Center found that more than one in five Black and Latinx households with children did not have enough to eat.4 Improved nutrition in school meals can help mitigate food insecurity in children and serve as an important tool against childhood obesity. The prevalence of obesity in children and adolescents is a growing problem in the U.S. In 2018, 19.3 percent of U.S. children and adolescents ages 2 to 19 had obesity, almost four times the rate of children and adolescents with obesity in the mid-1970s.5 Childhood obesity is linked to many consequences beyond those tied to physical health, including poor mental health outcomes and lower academic achievement.6 Regardless of age, studies show individuals with obesity have higher medical costs than healthy-weight individuals.7 For these reasons, it is critical that children have access to school meals that are reflective of the current nutrition science. Yet, the proposed changes weaken current nutrition standards and run contrary to the available nutrition science.
BPC is committed to sustaining evidence-based bipartisan solutions that work to improve the health of school-aged children nationwide. In 2012, BPC urged USDA to align school meals with evidence-based nutrition standards recommended in the National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM, formerly Institute of Medicine) 2009 report School Meals: Building Blocks for Healthy Children1 and the DGA.8 Overall, school nutrition has a notable bipartisan history. Under the Bush Administration, Congress passed the Child Nutrition Reauthorization Act of 2004, commissioning the pivotal 2009 NASEM report. During the Obama Administration, Congress passed the HHFKA, which instructed USDA to update nutrition standards for school meals, snacks, and beverages.
The proposed changes would undermine current nutrition science and Congressional intent as established through the HHFKA. The nutrition standards established through the HHFKA have been instrumental in protecting children’s health. One study found that the risk of obesity declined each year after the updated standards were implemented, so much so that obesity prevalence would have been 47 percent higher in 2018 without new standards.9 Though the HHFKA required school operators to make widespread changes, USDA’s 2019 School Nutrition and Meal Cost Study found that a majority of schools were able to meet the new meal requirements.10 In fact, schools with healthier meals saw increased participation rates in school meal programs without an increase in plate waste.11
BPC opposes the seven-year delay of the second sodium-reduction target and elimination of the third sodium-reduction target.
BPC opposes the seven-year delay of the second sodium-reduction targets and elimination of the third sodium-reduction target. Instead, BPC encourages USDA to wait to make changes to the nutrition standards until the final 2020-2025 DGA are released. NASEM updated the Dietary Reference Intake (DRI) for sodium in 2019,2 which is expected to be the basis of sodium recommendations in the upcoming 2020-2025 DGA.3 NASEM made even stronger sodium recommendations for school-aged children than those included in the existing nutrition standards due to updated research on the chronic disease impacts of sodium intake and widespread overconsumption of sodium in children. Currently, nine in ten children consume too much sodium, putting them at risk of high blood pressure, heart disease, and stroke.12,13 The proposed changes do not align with the most recent nutrition science, putting children’s health at risk.
BPC opposes weakening the whole-grain-rich standard from 100 percent to 50 percent.
Reducing the whole-grain-rich standard from 100 percent of grains to 50 percent does not align with the DGA recommendation to increase intake of whole grains and reduce intake of refined grains. Further, this change does not support children’s health considering that whole grains provide many nutrients and are a healthful source of fiber.14 Research shows that eating more whole grains is linked to reduced risk of heart disease, stroke, and diabetes.15 Children consume too few whole grains and too many refined grains.16
BPC appreciates the Department’s desire to assist schools in meeting the nutrition standards. However, USDA data shows that most (85%) schools are successfully meeting the 100-percent whole grain rich standard.17 This standard, which requires that grain products be more than 50 percent whole grain, already provides flexibility in allowing grain products to include a mix of whole and refined grains. Additionally, the 100-percent standard encourages manufacturers to provide healthy foods at a competitive price. With a 50 percent whole grain rich requirement, schools that wish to meet a 100-percent whole grain rich requirement would face difficulty procuring certain products that meet these standards because companies would not be incentivized to produce 100 percent whole-grain-rich products.
BPC opposes allowing flavored low-fat milk for school meals and as a competitive food.
Currently, flavored low-fat milk is not allowed in school meals based on expert recommendations from the NASEM 2009 report. Importantly, the current standards are supported by the 2015-2020 DGA. If included in school meals, flavored milk would provide more calories and likely exceed the calorie maximum for school meals. Instead, schools can serve plain or flavored fat-free milk and plain low-fat milk. BPC urges USDA to maintain this important standard.
Conclusion
Overall, BPC has significant concerns and does not support the proposed changes to the nutrition standards. The current standards for milk, whole-grains, and sodium align with current nutrition science and support children’s health. The changes would reverse important progress made in reducing childhood obesity and chronic disease risk at a time when children are at heightened risk of hunger and food insecurity due to COVID-19. Further, the proposed rollbacks do not align with the Congressional intent of the bipartisan HHFKA.
We appreciate the opportunity to express our concerns and look forward to continuing to work with you. If you have any questions or we can provide any additional information, please contact Tyler Barton at (202) 627-7918 or tbarton@bipartisanpolicy.org.

Those changes were widely opposed by the public2 and invalidated by a federal court over a lack of notice on key provisions.3
The importance of healthy school meals has taken on new urgency during the ongoing coronavirus outbreak. Given the severe economic impacts of COVID-19, more children will likely continue to qualify for free or reduced-priced school meals. For many of these children, school breakfast and lunch may be the only nutritious meals they will consume in a day. The percentage of people experiencing food insecurity since the pandemic began has doubled overall and tripled among households with children.4 Improved school nutrition is critical given that one out of three children and adolescents aged 2 to 19 years is overweight or obese5,6 and children can consume one-third to one-half of daily calories during the school day.7 These rollbacks fail to put children’s health first.
Thanks to the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010 (HHFKA), school meal, snack, and beverage standards were updated, access to free school meals was expanded, along with numerous other important provisions. The HHFKA is widely considered a significant public health success. Schools have made extraordinary progress toward serving healthier meals with less sodium, more whole grains, fruits, and vegetables, and removing soda, other sugary drinks, and unhealthy snack foods. Research shows that the 2012 and 2014 nutrition standards could prevent up to two million cases of childhood obesity and save up to $792 million in healthcare costs over ten years.8 Another study found that for children in poverty, the risk of obesity
declined substantially each year after implementation of HHFKA such that obesity prevalence
would have been 47 percent higher in 2018 if the nutrition standards had not been updated.9
Weakening these standards runs contrary to USDA’s 2019 School Nutrition and Meal Cost
Study (SNMCS). This study is the first nationally-representative study to assess school meals
after HHFKA and found that the nutritional quality of school lunches and breakfasts, measured
by the Healthy Eating Index (HEI-2010) scores,10 increased by 41 percent and 44 percent,

made significant progress on whole grains12 and sodium reduction13; a majority of schools met

Weakening the standards will increase disparities in healthy food access. Prior to HHFKA,
students in more affluent and large schools were more likely to have access to healthier foods
than those in under resourced and small schools in states with weaker standards than states with
stronger standards.17 The SNMCS found that the nutritional quality of school meals empowered
by HHFKA is the same across socioeconomic status and race and ethnicity.18 Further, few states
have policies on meal standards such as whole grains and flavored milk that would protect
children from these rollbacks.19
The 2012 updates to school nutrition standards reflect sound science, support children’s health,
and were developed in alignment with the 2010-2015 Dietary Guidelines for Americans (DGA)20
and the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM, formerly
Institute of Medicine) 2009 report School Meals: Building Blocks for Healthy Children.21
Weakening these standards is a further departure from aligning school meals with the DGA and
is not supported by the science or expert dietary advice.
Although Executive Orders 12866 and 13563 require agencies to assess costs and benefits of
regulatory actions and select approaches that maximize net benefits, including the effect on
public health and equity, USDA did not do these assessments for this proposed rule, nor did they
consult the public health or medical communities. Further, USDA has not released the Civil
Rights Impact Analysis for this proposed rule.
We oppose the proposed seven-year delay (from School Year 2017-2018 to School Year
2024-2025) of the second sodium reduction targets (Target 2) and elimination of the third
sodium-reduction targets (Target 3). USDA noted in the 2018 interim final rule (IFR) that first
rolled back these standards that they intended to re-evaluate the sodium reduction targets with
the release of the 2020-2025 DGA.22 Similarly in this proposed rule, USDA notes that the law,
“requires that school meals are consistent with the goals of the latest Dietary Guidelines for
Americans (Dietary Guidelines) (emphasis added).” NASEM updated the Dietary Reference
Intake (DRI) for sodium in 201923 which will be the basis for sodium recommendations in the
upcoming 2020-2025 DGA.24 That report established a Chronic Disease Risk Reduction (CDRR)
level for sodium in recognition that exceeding these levels would increase chronic disease risk
within a healthy population. NASEM made even stronger sodium recommendations for younger
school-aged children than was the case when the 2012 school meal standards were finalized:
lowering the limit for sodium from 2,200 mg to 1,800 mg for children aged 9-13 and from 1,900
mg to 1,500 mg for children aged 4-8.25 Therefore, the Department should wait until after the
2020-2025 DGA are issued given its imminent release. 26 The stakes for children’s health could
not be higher: nine out of ten children consume too much sodium,27 increasing their risk of high
blood pressure, heart disease, and stroke.28 Further, many schools, food service companies, and
others in industry have already made healthy and appealing meals and products with less sodium
and rolling back these standards will reduce demand for lower-sodium products, making it harder
for schools that want to offer lower-sodium products to do so.
We oppose weakening the whole grain standard from 100 percent of grains served being
whole grain-rich to only 50 percent. This change is inconsistent with the DGA and does not
support children’s health. Eating more whole grains is associated with reduced risk of heart
disease, stroke, and diabetes. Whole grains also provide more nutrients and are a healthful source
of fiber.29 Children, on average, consume too few whole grains and too many refined grains.30
USDA’s 2018 IFR showed that the vast majority of schools (85 percent) were meeting the 100 percent whole grain-rich standard.31 Similarly to rolling back sodium standards, rolling back the
whole-grain-rich standard will make it harder for schools that want to continue to offer 100
percent whole-grain-rich to do so. Anecdotally, several school foodservice directors have stated
that the whole-grain-rich products they were successfully offering are no longer available, and as
a result they have been forced to switch to a non-whole-grain-rich option.
We oppose allowing flavored low-fat (1 percent) milk for school meals and as a competitive
food. The current standards that allow plain or flavored fat-free milk and plain low-fat milk are
based on expert recommendations from the NASEM’s 2009 report.32 Those recommendations
disallowed flavored low-fat milk because it would provide more calories and likely exceed the
calorie maximum for school meals. The 2015 DGA similarly recommended, “increasing the
proportion of dairy intake that is fat-free or low-fat milk” and “reducing the intake of added
sugars” such as those in flavored milk.33 Similarly, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation’s
Healthier Beverage Guidelines recommend only plain fat-free and low-fat milk for children and
adolescents.34 While the calorie ranges for age groups and grade were intended to limit meals
with excessive amounts of added sugar, flavored skim milk is the most sugary item in breakfast
and lunch35 and flavored low-fat milk will likely exacerbate this trend.
In addition, this proposed rule is part of a larger effort to roll back the nutrition standards and
weaken the program. Earlier this year, USDA proposed widening the junk food loophole that
would allow schools to serve more entrée items as competitive foods without meeting the Smart
Snacks standards, reduce the variety of vegetables, and reduce the amount of fruit in breakfast in
the classroom, among other problematic changes.36 If those proposed rollbacks go into effect,
research estimates the junk food loophole would add approximately 662 mg of sodium and 3 g of
saturated fat over three days (or 1103 mg sodium and 5 g saturated fat over a week) on average
relative to Smart Snacks limits currently in place.37 Further, a Health Impact Assessment found
the additional proposed changes would adversely affect students’ health and academic
performance, and that students from low-income families attending schools that are majority
Black or Hispanic and in rural neighborhoods are most likely to be impacted by the proposed
changes (while this study focused on the 2020 proposed rollbacks, it can also be generally
applied to the rollbacks in this proposed rule).38
We are also concerned about the timing of this proposed rule and shortest possible 30-day
comment period is problematic. As mentioned earlier, this proposed rule is premature, given the
imminent release of the 2020-2025 DGA.39 Because this rule was released before the DGAs, the
public and other stakeholders are not able to determine if the proposed changes to the sodium, whole grains, and milk standards are consistent with the latest dietary recommendations. The 30-day comment period may also make it difficult for stakeholders to comment. Many schools and impacted organizations are dealing with COVID-related feeding issues and are not able to devote adequate time to preparing comments. Executive Order 12866 advises that agencies should generally provide, at a minimum, at least 60 days for public comment.40
Additional detailed comments follow:
The delay of Target 2 and elimination of Target 3 would harm children’s health
Unfortunately, children on average consume between 2,500 to 4,200 mg of sodium per day, well over the recommended levels.41 Excess sodium consumption is strongly associated with the development and worsening of high blood pressure and an increased risk of coronary heart disease, stroke, heart failure, kidney failure, gastric cancer, and osteoporosis.42 A substantial number of studies show that as dietary sodium intake rises, so does blood pressure.43 Studies show a link between high blood pressure in childhood and high blood pressure in adulthood, and high blood pressure in childhood is linked to early development of heart disease and risk for premature death.44
Of concern, the prevalence of high blood pressure is increasing in American children.45 Already about one in six children aged 8-17 have raised blood pressure.46 Children are at higher risk of developing heart disease and elevated blood pressure at earlier ages if they are obese or eat too much sodium.47 Children who eat higher-sodium diets are about 40 percent more likely to have elevated blood pressure than children who eat lower-sodium diets.48
The good news is that lowering sodium consumption can have a tremendous impact on public health. Studies show that reduced sodium intake can lower blood pressure, control hypertension, and prevent cardiovascular disease.49,50 In addition, lowering sodium consumption, and thereby lowering blood pressure, can reduce medical costs. From 2012 to 2013, high blood pressure cost the United States an estimated $51.2 billion in direct and indirect costs.51
Along with the DGA, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the World Health Organization, the American Heart Association, and other experts all recommend limiting sodium intake to less than 2,300 mg.52 The CDRR level for sodium in children aged 4-8 years and 9-13 years is even lower, at 1,900 mg and 2,200 mg, respectively.53 At the current levels (Target 1), a high school lunch has on average 1,420 mg, or about two-thirds a day’s worth.
In anticipation of schools being required to meet the original sodium-reduction targets, companies have worked hard to reformulate their products. For example, school food company Revolution Foods already provides school meals that meet the Target 3 sodium levels. Schwan’s Company—the largest producer of school pizza—produces the pizza for Revolution Foods and has already invested in the technology and resources to make appealing school pizzas that meet Targets 2 and 3. In addition, many companies—including Aramark,54 ConAgra Foods,55 Domino’s Pizza (Smart Slice),56 General Mills,57 Kellogg’s,58 Kraft Foods,59 Mars,60 Nestlé,61 PepsiCo,62 and Unilever63—are engaged in voluntary sodium reduction across their full lines of consumer products, which should aid school sodium reduction efforts. And we expect industry efforts will soon intensify as the Food and Drug Administration is preparing to release voluntary sodium reduction targets for processed, packaged, and restaurant foods. This also complements state and local efforts such as New York City’s National Salt and Sugar Reduction Initiative64 and CDC’s Sodium Reduction in Communities Program.65 A variety of methods and technologies are available to help reduce levels of sodium in many food categories.66
While we are not aware of USDA collecting data on implementation beyond Target 1, we know that prior to the pandemic, many schools had been working hard and are at or very close to meeting Target 2 levels. For example, the school meals program in Elbert County Schools, Georgia has done tremendous work to get their menus down to safe levels of sodium. They have employed tactics such as training staff to analyze sodium content in their menus; educating students on nutrition and menu changes; working with local and regional companies to find alternative products that met their sodium needs; and re-working their recipes to keep their foods with less sodium appealing to students.67 Other schools have also lowered sodium by using spice bars and salad bars that gives students more options to provide flavor with less salt. Schools all around the country—from Virginia to California, Indiana to Kansas, Oklahoma to New York, and Georgia to North Dakota—have successfully used these best practices to meet the Target 1 and Target 2 sodium levels. USDA should put greater effort into elevating and sharing these methods and encouraging their adoption by other schools around the country.
USDA programs like “Team Up for School Nutrition Success” and the “What's Shaking?” initiative have been beneficial, but USDA has not kept these programs active. Congress has recognized the need to provide dedicated technical assistance on sodium reduction for schools and included $1 million in the House FY202068 and FY202169 Agriculture Appropriations bills (the funding was not included in the FY2020 final spending bill and at the time of this writing FY2021 is still being negotiated). USDA needs to focus on targeted technical assistance that delivers more intensive and personalized training for those programs that may still have difficulties lowering sodium. In addition, the USDA Foods (commodities) program has set a good example for schools by providing more moderate-sodium options and that work should continue.
Weakening the whole grain-rich standard would harm children’s health
The 2015 DGA recommends making at least half of all grains whole grain.70 Children aged 4 to 18 do not meet the recommended intake for whole grains and exceed the recommended limit for refined grains.71 Eating more whole grains is associated with reduced risk of heart disease, stroke, and diabetes, provides more nutrients, and are a healthful source of fiber. 72
Prior to the 2018 rollbacks, whole grain-rich products were widely prevalent in the marketplace. In December 2017, the Alliance for a Healthier Generation’s Smart Food Planner, an online database that featured food and beverage products that align with the school nutrition standards, showed that approximately 874 whole grain-rich products were currently available for purchase by schools (the Alliance no longer maintains this database).73 Further, USDA Foods provides more whole grain products and has developed a number of resources that list whole grain-rich options.74
Many schools across the U.S. are offering whole grain-rich products on their menus that students enjoy. Successful strategies for encouraging students to eat more whole grains include student surveys, samples and taste tests, experimenting with new products and recipes, and peer-to-peer sharing of food preparation techniques. These techniques have also been successful in sodium reduction efforts.
USDA had noted in the 2018 IFR that 85 percent of schools had not requested waivers and are providing children with appealing whole grain options. Some states did not have any schools requesting waivers such as Alabama, Idaho, and Montana, and others did not allow waivers such as Arkansas, Maryland, and Rhode Island.75 Some states had multiple waivers for only one type of product (e.g., pasta) like South Dakota, while North Dakota does not. If the vast majority of schools can provide whole grain-rich options, the rest should be able to as well. We encourage USDA to instead provide additional training and technical assistance to school districts that currently are asking for waivers and are having difficulty meeting the whole grain-rich requirement.
Allowing flavored low-fat (1%) milk is inconsistent with expert dietary advice and school needs
Allowing schools to serve flavored low-fat milk would be inconsistent with expert nutrition recommendations based on the National Academy of Medicine’s 2009 report76 and the 2015 DGA.77 Similarly, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation’s Healthier Beverage Guidelines recommend only plain fat-free and low-fat milk for children and adolescents.78
According to USDA’s report Special Nutrition Program Operations Study School Year 2013-2014, only 13 percent of school food authorities (SFAs) found the milk standards challenging overall—this rate was the second lowest reported for any food category.79 For breakfast, the rate was even lower, at six percent—the lowest reported among all challenges.80 When the new milk requirements went into effect, 75 percent of SFAs stated that they did not observe any change in the amount of milk wasted, suggesting that student acceptance was not a problem.81 Further, roughly one in five SFAs reported choosing milk as the item to offer students who requested more food on the lunch line, showing that it remains an appealing beverage option for students.82 Finally, virtually all SFAs (more than 90 percent) have employed strategies to encourage milk consumption, such as displaying plain milk in all-milk coolers, having plain milk account for at least one-third of the drinks displayed in each cooler, and placing plain milk in front of or before flavored milk or other sugary beverages.83 USDA should encourage these strategies and address any remaining challenges for the few SFAs through training and technical assistance.
Conclusion
We oppose delaying Sodium Target 2 and eliminating Sodium Target 3, weakening the whole grain-rich standard from 100 to 50 percent of all grains served, and allowing flavored low-fat milk. These rollbacks are counter to sound science, will harm children’s health, increase disparities, and dissuade industry innovation. Instead of weakening nutrition standards, we urge the administration to provide the technical assistance needed to support schools struggling with meeting the existing standards, and reconsider science-based standards that are consistent with the most recent DGA.

2020,FNS-2020-0038-0775,,Other government agency - (non school),"Dear Ms. Namian: 
My name is Lois Woods, I have worked as a nutritionist in the WIC program for 18 years and directed the program in Abilene, TX for the past 4 years. During this time, I had the privilege to function as the lead officer implementing the required changes for Early Care Education (ECE) facilities as a result of Senate Bill (SB) 952. This SB specifically aimed to implement best practices in ECE facility to establish healthy behaviors in the areas of nutrition and physical active. I write in strong opposition of USDA’s proposed rule to weaken school meals nutrition standards. WIC along with other ECE facilities are targeted, time-limited programs that lays the foundations for healthy child growth and development. WIC’s nutritious foods, aligned with the Dietary Guidelines for Americans, are demonstrated to improve dietary quality, and recent research from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) noted a decline in the prevalence of childhood obesity among WIC toddlers, crediting the 2009 revisions in the WIC food package. To weaken school meal nutrition standards is to take one step forward and 2 backwards!
 When children age off WIC on their fifth birthday, the families that we serve often turn to the National School Lunch and School Breakfast Programs to ensure that their children continue to have regular access to healthy foods. The school meals programs continue WIC’s important work of enhancing children’s access to nutritious foods. Strengthening school meals nutrition standards honors the work of all organization striving to reduce childhood obesity and increase health outcomes throughout the life span including WIC.
After passage of the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010, USDA underwent thoughtful review and issued nutrition standards in 2012 and 2014. A prior USDA attempt to reverse or delay these standards in 2018 was invalidated by a federal court for lack of notice on several substantive provisions. Now, USDA proposes changes similar to the 2018 rule with only a 30-day comment period. This is a departure from regular administrative processes, as a comment period of no less than 60 days is recommended by Executive Order 12866. Especially given USDA’s prior efforts, the comment period should be extended to provide full public input. We write in concern of weakened nutrition standards. The stronger standards for school meals programs could have significant impacts, preventing up to two million cases of childhood obesity and saving up to $792 million in healthcare expenditures. These results echo WIC’s success of enhancing dietary quality and health outcomes for young children with strong food packages aligned with the Dietary Guidelines for Americans. Weaker standards and prolonged delays for sodium and whole-grains will only disrupt industry efforts to reformulate products and transition toward healthier options. Instead of rushed, last-minute changes and delays, USDA should double-down on the existing standards and provide the necessary technical assistance to support school meals programs in transitioning toward science-based, nutritious options that will promote positive child health and development.

2020,FNS-2020-0038-0777,,Academic researchers,"On behalf of the Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS), I submit this comment to the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) Food and Nutrition Service to express strong opposition to the dismantling of evidence-based school nutrition standards via the policy changes contained in the proposed rule “Restoration of Milk, Whole Grains, and Sodium Flexibilities.”
UCS is a science-based nonprofit working for a healthy environment and a safer world. Our organization combines independent scientific research and citizen action to develop innovative, practical solutions to some of the nation’s most pressing challenges and secure responsible changes in government policy, corporate practices, and consumer choices.
The nutrition standards established under the bipartisan Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010 (HHFKA) were developed in alignment with federal dietary guidelines to support healthy eating behaviors and reduce long-term risk of chronic disease among our nation’s children. Existing school nutrition standards under HHFKA on milk, whole grains, and sodium remain consistent with the best available science, as indicated by the recommendations contained in the Scientific Report of the 2020 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee.1
The importance of healthy school meals has taken on new urgency during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, which has contributed to food insecurity rates tripling among households with children and doubling among all US households.2 Given the severe economic impacts of COVID-19, more children will likely continue to qualify for free or reduced-priced school meals, and for many, school breakfast and lunch may be the only nutritious meals they will consume in a day. The unsubstantiated rollbacks in this final rule fail our nation’s children, and instead prioritize the profits of food companies who have a history of challenging the nutrition standards implemented by the HHFKA.3
Our opposition to the proposed rule is grounded in the following:
The proposed changes to milk, whole grains, and sodium in school meals are inconsistent with current science and national dietary guidance.
The proposed rule contradicts the 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans, which explicitly recommend a healthy eating pattern that includes whole grains and limits saturated fats, added sugars, and sodium.4
These recommendations have largely been reiterated—and in some cases, strengthened—in the Scientific Report of the 2020 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee, which provides the scientific basis for the 2020-2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans. The Committee found that “common characteristics of dietary patterns associated with positive health outcomes, include higher intake of vegetables, fruits, legumes, whole grains, low- or non-fat dairy, lean meat and poultry, seafood, nuts and unsaturated vegetable oils and low consumption of red and processed meats, sugar-sweetened foods and drinks, and refined grains.” It also reported that the typical diet consumed in the US results in overconsumption of total energy, saturated fats, sodium, and added sugars, and low intake of whole grains, among other food groups.1
The Committee further reduced the recommended level of added sugar in the diet from a maximum of 10 percent of total calories to 6 percent, acknowledging that this reduced threshold is “more consistent with a dietary pattern that is nutritionally adequate while avoiding excess energy intake from added sugars.” This recommendation is consistent with our own research, detailed in a 2019 report, Delivering on the Dietary Guidelines, which found that a 6 percent limit on added sugars would be the highest level at which the average individual could meet all other nutritional recommendations.5
There is no evidence to support the proposed changes, which contradict existing research and reporting on school nutrition compliance nationwide.
Among the stated aims of the proposed rule are to address significant challenges faced by school food operators and to ensure that children are served nutritious and appealing meals. However, the USDA indicated in 2016 that more than 99 percent of schools nationwide were already meeting the HHFKA standards.6 Furthermore, the School Nutrition and Meal Cost Study published by the USDA in 2019 reported increased fruit and vegetable consumption among kids, higher school meal participation, and no change in food waste in the years following adoption of the new nutrition standards, undermining the department’s claim that widespread implementation challenges persist.7 As the federal agency responsible for overseeing child nutrition programs, the USDA has played a critical role in providing resources and assistance to help schools meet new standards and to help students learn healthy eating behaviors, and must continue to do so.
The proposed rule threatens to exacerbate diet-related health disparities and puts the health of millions of children at risk.
Children consume more than half of their daily calories at school; for low-income and food-insecure children, this is likely a severe underestimate.8 With more than 45 million students eating meals and snacks at school each day, school meals offer a critical opportunity to support healthy behaviors and reduce long-term chronic disease risk—making evidence-based school nutrition standards one of the best public health tools at our disposal.9,10 Studies suggest that the HHFKA is one of the most effective strategies for reducing childhood obesity and predict the policy will prevent more than 2 million cases over the span of 10 years, leading researchers at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health to name it “one of the most important national obesity prevention policy achievements in recent decades.”11
The vast majority of children participating in school meal programs are from low-income households. In recent years, 74 percent of lunches and 85 percent of breakfasts were provided either for free or at reduced cost to students based on household income level.12 One study found that a group of primarily low-income students obtained 47 percent of their daily calories at school, including 58 percent of fruit intake, 41 percent of vegetable intake, 52 percent of grain intake, and 70 percent of total milk intake.13 Though nutritious meals confer benefits to all participating children, the nutritional quality of foods provided at school is particularly important for children from low-income households. Research has consistently shown that low-income households do not achieve parity with higher-income households when it comes to diet quality, even after adjusting for education and other factors.14,15
The relationship between poverty and race in the United States means that children of color are also more likely to participate in school meal programs. Recent research has shown that, due in part to decades of racist policies and practices promoting school segregation, Black children are more than twice as likely than White children to attend high-poverty schools where more than half of the student population is eligible for free or reduced-price lunch.16 Meanwhile, it is estimated that Hispanic students represent about one-quarter of all children participating in the school lunch program, and make up nearly one-third of children who receive free and reduced-price lunches.17 Regardless of income level, many children of color face unique challenges to eating healthfully as a result of unhealthy food marketing, which is itself a contributor to poor diets and diet-related disease. Findings from the University of Connecticut’s Rudd Center for Food Policy and Obesity have shown that restaurants and food and beverage companies disproportionately market their least nutritious products, including fast food, candy, sugary drinks, and snacks, to Black and Hispanic youth, including in school settings.18
Research has found that the nutrition standards implemented by the HHFKA were effective in reducing numerous disparities related to the nutritional quality of school meals. For example, a 2015 study showed that prior to the introduction of the new standards, students in predominantly White schools were more likely to have healthier options, including fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, and less likely to have sugar-sweetened beverages available on a daily basis; after the introduction of the new standards, these disparities were largely eliminated.19 Rolling back science-based regulations may erase these gains entirely, exacerbating existing inequities and health disparities that disproportionately affect low-income populations and communities of color and putting many children on a path to poorer health.20
Weakening the nutrition standards established in the HHFKA by permitting the use of whole grain waivers, delaying sodium targets, and allowing milk choices with higher levels of added sugar and saturated fat diminishes our ability to achieve these public health gains. It is essential that any changes to school meals program represent the best available science and are free of unsubstantiated influence that may work against the interests of our nation’s children.
Thank you for your careful consideration of the comments provided by UCS and leading public health and nutrition experts in response to the proposed rule “Restoration of Milk, Whole Grains, and Sodium Flexibilities.” Rather than dismantling effective, evidence-based bipartisan policy, we urge the USDA to continue providing the critical support schools need to ensure children are provided with nutritious meals—particularly in the height of a global public health crisis—and the best opportunity for a healthy future.

2020,FNS-2020-0038-0875,,Advocacy,"The Association of State Public Health Nutritionists (ASPHN)1 respectfully submits
comments in response to the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) proposed rule
entitled: “Restoration of Milk, Whole Grains, and Sodium Flexibilities” (85 FR 75241).
The proposal would reinstitute the changes to the School Breakfast Program (SBP) and
National School Lunch Program (NSLP) sodium, whole grains, and flavored milk
requirements (83 FR 63775, December 12, 2018).
The importance of healthy school meals has taken on a heightened urgency due to a
prolonged and costly coronavirus pandemic. Due the stark economic impact of COVID-
19, the percentage of Americans experiencing food insecurity has doubled overall and
tripled among households with children.2 For many of these children, school breakfast
and lunch may be the only nutritious meals they will consume in a day. The proposed
rollbacks will expose America’s children to considerable health risks.
The nutritional quality of school meals established by the Healthy Hunger-Free Kids Act
(HHFKA) of 2010 is the same across socioeconomic status and race and ethnicity.3
Weakening the standards will significantly increase disparities in healthy food access.
Furthermore, weakening these standards is a far-off departure from aligning school meals
with the Dietary Guidelines for Americans (DGA)4 and is not supported by the science or
expert dietary advice. By law, school meals are required to be consistent with the goals of
the latest DGAs.
The 2012 updates to school nutrition standards were developed in alignment with the
2010-2015 DGAs and the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine
(NASEM, formerly Institute of Medicine) 2009 report School Meals: Building Blocks for
Healthy Children.5 NASEM established a Chronic Disease Risk Reduction (CDRR) level
for sodium in recognition that exceeding these levels would increase chronic disease risk
within a healthy population. NASEM made even stronger sodium recommendations for
younger school-aged children than was the case when the 2012 school meal standards
were finalized.6 The Dietary Reference Intake (DRI) for sodium were updated in 2019 7
and will be the basis for sodium recommendations in the upcoming 2020-2025 DGA.8
ASPHN ardently opposes the proposed seven-year delay (from School Year 2017-
2018 to School Year 2024-2025) of the second sodium reduction targets (Target 2)
and elimination of the third sodium-reduction targets (Target 3). Nine out of ten
children consume sodium in excess.9 Today’s children on average consume between
2,500 to 4,200 mg of sodium per day, well over the recommended levels.10 Research
shows that increased rates of dietary sodium intake, correlates strongly with increased
rates of high blood pressure.11 Children who eat higher-sodium diets are about 40 percent
more likely to have elevated blood pressure than children who eat lower-sodium diets.12
High blood pressure in childhood is also linked to high blood pressure in adulthood, early
development of heart disease, increased risk of stroke, heart failure, kidney failure,
gastric cancer, and osteoporosis and risk for premature death.13,14
ASPHN also opposes weakening the whole grain standard from 100 percent of
grains served being whole grain-rich to only 50 percent. Again, the proposed change
is inconsistent with the DGA. On average, children are currently consuming too few
whole grains and far too many refined carbohydrates.15 The 2015 DGA recommends that
at least half of all grains consumed be whole grain.16 Eating more whole grains is
associated with reduced risk of heart disease, stroke, and diabetes, provides more
nutrients, and are a healthful source of fiber. 17,18
ASPHN opposes allowing flavored low-fat (1 percent) milk for school meals and as a
competitive food. Permitting schools to serve flavored low-fat milk would be
inconsistent with expert nutrition recommendations based on the National Academy of
Medicine’s 2009 report19 and the 2015 DGA.20 The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation’s
Healthier Beverage Guidelines recommend only plain fat-free and low-fat milk for
children and adolescents.21 The 2015 DGA similarly recommended, “increasing the
proportion of dairy intake that is fat-free or low-fat milk” and “reducing the intake of
added sugars” such as those in flavored milk.22
The current standards that allow plain or flavored fat-free milk and plain low-fat milk are
based on expert recommendations from the NASEM’s 2009 report.23 The NASEM
recommendations disallowed flavored low-fat milk because it would provide more
calories and likely exceed the calorie maximum for school meals. The calorie ranges for
age groups and grade were intended to limit meals with excessive amounts of added
sugar. Flavored skim milk is the highest sugar item for breakfast and lunch24 and flavored
low-fat milk will likely intensify this trend.
Previously, USDA proposed widening the junk food loophole which would allow schools
to serve more entrée items as competitive foods without meeting the Smart Snacks
standards, reduce the variety of vegetables, and reduce the amount of fruit in breakfast in
the classroom.25 Research estimates that on average, the junk food loophole would
greatly exacerbate the amount of both sodium and saturated fat in these food items
relative to the Smart Snacks limits currently in place.26
Finally, better-quality school nutrition is critical, given that one out of three children and
adolescents aged 2 to 19 years is overweight or obese27,28 Another study found that for
children in poverty, the risk of obesity declined substantially each year after
implementation of HHFKA such that obesity prevalence would have been 47 percent
higher in 2018 if the nutrition standards had not been updated.29 From 2012 to 2013, high
blood pressure cost the United States an estimated $51.2 billion in direct and indirect
costs.30 Research shows that the 2012 and 2014 nutrition standards could prevent up to
two million cases of childhood obesity and save up to $792 million in healthcare costs
over ten years.31
ASPHN, therefore urges the Department to reschedule implementing the proposed
changes until after the 2020-2025 DGAs are issued. 32As mentioned earlier, this proposed
rule would be premature, given the forthcoming release of the 2020-2025 DGA.33 The
30-day comment period may also make it difficult for stakeholders to comment. Many
schools and impacted organizations are dealing with COVID-related feeding issues and
are not able to devote adequate time to preparing comments. Moreover, Executive Order
12866 advises that agencies should generally provide, at a minimum, at least 60 days for
public comment.34
In summary, ASPHN opposes delaying Sodium Target 2 and eliminating Sodium Target
3, weakening the whole grain-rich standard from 100 to 50 percent of all grains served,
and allowing flavored low-fat milk. Instead of weakening our nutrition standards, we
encourage the administration to provide the technical assistance needed to support
schools struggling to meet the existing standards, and then align any new standards to be
science-based and consistent with the most recent DGA.

2020,FNS-2020-0038-1063,,Other,"The Pew Charitable Trusts respectfully submits these comments in response to the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) proposed rule entitled: “Restoration of Milk, Whole Grains, and Sodium Flexibilities” (85 FR 75241). Pew is a nonpartisan research and policy organization with a longstanding focus on public health.
The Kids' Safe and Healthful Foods (KSHF) Project, a collaboration between Pew and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, provided nonpartisan analysis and evidence-based recommendations on policies that affect the safety and healthfulness of school foods during implementation of the Healthy, Hunger Free Kids Act of 2010 (HHFKA).1 While the KSHF project concluded its work in 2017, Pew is submitting comments on its own behalf on the current proposal out of concern that the proposed changes to the 2012 school nutrition standards do not meet the letter and the spirit of the HHFKA.
Pew opposes the proposed changes and urges the Department to withdraw the proposed rule. These rollbacks are counter to sound science and will harm children’s health. This proposal would reinstitute the changes to the School Breakfast Program (SBP) and National School Lunch Program (NSLP) regarding sodium, whole grains, and flavored milk requirements that were finalized in December 2018.2 These changes delayed the next levels of sodium reduction by seven years and eliminated sodium-reduction Target 3; cut the whole grain-rich standard in half from 100 to 50 percent; and allowed flavored low-fat (1 percent) milk to be sold without a calorie (and/or added sugar). A federal court struck down the 2018 Final Rule on the grounds that it went beyond what USDA had proposed in the interim final rule issued in 2017, and, as such, it was not a “logical outgrowth” of the initial proposal.3 The court vacated the rule and remanded it to USDA, which issued this proposal to “restore” the changes it made in the 2018 Final Rule.
As a threshold matter, we urge the Department to wait to consider any changes to the 2012 school nutrition standards until after the 2020-2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans (DGAs) are issued, which should happen imminently.
4 USDA noted in the 2017 Interim Final Rule (IFR) in this proceeding that they intended to re-evaluate the sodium reduction targets with the release of the next iteration of the DGAs.5 Similarly in this proposed rule, USDA notes that the law, “requires that school meals are consistent with the goals of the latest Dietary Guidelines for Americans” (emphasis added).”6
Improved school nutrition is critical to child health and well-being given that one out of three children and adolescents aged 2 to 19 years is overweight or obese7,8 and that children consume one-third to one-half of daily calories during the school day.9
The 2012 school nutrition standards that implement the HHFKA are based on sound science. They reflect the 2010-2015 DGAs, which were further confirmed by the 2015-2020 DGAs.10 The 2012 standards also reflect the recommendations made in the National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM, formerly, Institute of Medicine) report School Meals: Building Blocks for Healthy Children.11 Public health researchers praised the 2012 school meal standards as “one of the most important national obesity prevention policy achievements in recent decades,” estimated that these improvements could prevent more than two million cases of childhood obesity and save up to $792 million in health-care related costs over ten years.12 In the first few years that the 2012 school nutrition standards were in place, they were already making a difference. By September 2016, nearly all districts were meeting the healthier standards,13 despite some early challenges. Students of all ages were choosing lunches higher in nutritional quality;14 and an overwhelming percent of school food directors saw rising or stable revenue.15
More recent studies document the continued success of the 2012 school nutrition standards. One 2017 study that examined the experiences of Food Service Directors (FSDs) said they were making positive headway in implementing school meal reforms.16 A 2019 study that looked at 401 elementary and middle schools found that, compared to data collected at the beginning of implementation of the new standards, more schools reported meeting reimbursable school meal nutrition standards; in particular, most grains offered were whole grain rich. The authors found that the HHFKA was feasible across a wide variety of schools and that schools successfully implemented reimbursable school meal nutrition standards regardless of school poverty level.17 Moreover, a 2020 study found that updated nutrition standards have significantly improved the nutritional quality of school lunches and breakfasts.18
Even USDA’s own research demonstrates the effectiveness of these standards. A 2017 report found that virtually all schools (99 percent) participating in the National School Lunch Program (NSLP) and School Breakfast Program (SBP) have made and are making great progress toward serving healthier meals for participating children with less sodium; more whole grains, fruits, and vegetables; and fewer sugary drinks and unhealthy snacks.19 And a 2019 USDA report, School Nutrition and Meal Cost Study, which gathered data from more than 1,200 schools nationwide – the most comprehensive study on the updated standards to date – found that the nutritional quality of school lunches and breakfasts, measured by the HEI-2010 [Healthy Eating Index] scores, 20 increased by 41 percent and 44 percent, respectively, between school years 2009-10 and 2014-15.21
Proponents of the proposed changes in the school nutrition standards cite decreasing participation as justification for weakening child nutrition; however, the data show that any declining participation is not a result of the 2012 standards. USDA’s School Nutrition and Meal Cost Study in fact found that participation is highest in schools with the healthiest meals.22 Participation among students receiving free meals has dramatically increased over the past decade (from 15.4 million children in 2008 to 20 million children in 2019),
23 and overall participation remains high with about 30 million students participating in 2019.
USDA also claims that there has been increased food waste with the 2012 standards. However, there is robust evidence that the nutrition standards do not lead to increased plate waste but instead ensure children are eating healthier foods at school. Multiple peer-reviewed studies comparing plate waste before and after the HHFKA have found that food waste actually decreased following the implementation of the new standards and children were eating more fruits and vegetables.24
It is unclear how many schools are facing the problems that USDA says justify the proposed changes. Any challenges schools face in meeting the 2012 standards should be addressed not through weakening the standards but, rather, through additional technical assistance and support for local school nutrition administrators’ efforts to encourage student acceptance of new recipes and meal plans that meet those standards. These efforts include changing the time of day and length of time to eat; involving students in taste tests and meal planning; renaming and presenting the food in kid-friendly and appealing ways; providing adequate kitchen equipment; improving nutrition education; and scheduling recess before lunch.
We address below the proposed changes related to sodium consumption and consumption of whole grains. Pew believes that, if the re-proposed changes to the school nutrition standards are finalized, they would jeopardize the progress schools are making to provide healthier food to vulnerable children and decrease the overall healthfulness of school meals.
We oppose the proposed seven-year delay of the second sodium reduction target and elimination of the third target.
In 2019, the NASEM updated the Dietary Reference Intake (DRI) for sodium,25 which are the basis for sodium recommendations in the upcoming 2020-2025 DGAs.26 The DRI report established a Chronic Disease Risk Reduction level for sodium in recognition that exceeding these levels would increase chronic disease risk within a healthy population. NASEM made even stronger sodium recommendations for younger school-aged children than was the case when the 2012
school meal standards were finalized: lowering the limit for sodium from 2,200 mg to 1,800 mg for children aged 9-13 and from 1,900 mg to 1,500 mg for children aged 4-8.27 The stakes for children’s health could not be higher: nine out of ten children consume too much sodium,
28 increasing their risk of high blood pressure, heart disease, and stroke.29 Further, many schools, food service companies, and others in industry have already made healthy and appealing meals and products with less sodium. Rolling back these standards will reduce demand for lower-sodium products, making it harder for schools that want to offer lower-sodium products to do so.
We oppose weakening the whole grain standard from 100 percent to 50 percent of grains.
This proposed change is inconsistent with the DGAs and does not support children’s health. Eating more whole grains is associated with reduced risk of heart disease, stroke, and diabetes. Whole grains also provide more nutrients and are a healthful source of fiber.30 Children, on average, consume too few whole grains and too many refined grains.31 In fact, in the December 2018 Final Rule, USDA acknowledged that the vast majority (80 percent) of school food
authorities were meeting the whole grain requirement and did not request exemptions in SY 2017–2018.32 Similarly to rolling back sodium standards, rolling back the whole-grain-rich standard will decrease the supply of available products, making it harder for schools that want to continue to offer 100 percent whole-grain-rich to do so.
Conclusion
We oppose delaying Sodium Target 2 and eliminating Sodium Target 3 as well as weakening the whole grain-rich standard from 100 to 50 percent of all grains served. These rollbacks are counter to sound science, will harm children’s health, and dissuade industry innovation. Instead of weakening nutrition standards, we urge USDA to provide the technical assistance needed to support schools struggling with meeting the existing standards. Rather than rush to complete this rulemaking, USDA should withdraw it and wait to reevaluate this school nutrition proposal until the newest DGAs are released.

2020,FNS-2020-0038-2729,,Advocacy,"Please see attached comments of Consumer Federation of America. 
To whom it may concern:
Consumer Federation of America writes to oppose the above-referenced proposed rule by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). Similar to the USDA’s illegal 2018 interim final rule, “Child Nutrition Programs: Flexibilities for Milk, Whole Grains, and Sodium Requirements,” the proposed rule would operate to reverse progress that the National School Lunch and Breakfast Programs have made in serving healthier meals, instead foisting upon the nation’s children a surfeit of junk food products laden with excessive salt, added sugars, and refined carbohydrates. USDA should stop pandering to the purveyors of low quality school meals. The agency should abandon this proposed rule and work to support schools and children’s health by bringing school nutrition standards into greater conformity with the Dietary Guidelines for Americans, and by providing technical and other appropriate assistance to schools that need help meeting the standards.
As we explained in our previous comments on the interim final rule, the National School Lunch and Breakfast Programs—updated under the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010 (HHFKA)—have made tremendous progress in serving healthier meals with less salt, less fat (and no trans fat), fewer added sugars, and more fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. Those changes are extremely popular, with surveys showing overwhelming support for the new nutrition standards among consumers.1 However, industry opponents of healthier school meals succeeded for several years in blocking implementation of the law, persuading members of Congress to pass appropriations riders that prevented the standards from going into full effect. With its 2018 interim final rule, USDA took the unprecedented step of attempting to carry out anticipated congressional intent, reasoning that Congress’ past “repetitive legislative action manifests a clear Congressional message to USDA.” As we argued then, this attempt to shield Congress from accountability was unlawful, and earlier this year, a federal court agreed.2
Now, USDA seeks to once again do what it claimed Congress instructed it to do, but on the basis of sound science and evidence. The science and evidence, however, support doing more to improve school meal nutrition, not less.
The importance of healthy school meals has become increasingly apparent as Americans struggle to meet the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic. The percentage of households with children that are experiencing food insecurity has tripled since the pandemic began.3 For many of the children in these households, school meals represent their most important source of nutrition. Healthier school meals are key to addressing the epidemic of childhood obesity facing the nation. Fully one third of children aged 2 to 19 are overweight or obese, and like COVID-19, the obesity epidemic has disproportionately affected poor and minority communities.4 In a cruel twist, researchers have documented how obesity dramatically increases mortality from COVID-19, with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advising that “having obesity may triple the risk of hospitalization due to a COVID-19 infection.”5
Fortunately, research also shows that higher standards for school meals make a difference. Researchers have documented how the nutritional quality of school meals increased in the years following the HHFKA’s passage by over 40%, without an increase in so-called “plate waste.”6 Researchers credit this boost in nutrition with substantial declines in the risk of obesity among children in poverty,7 and hundreds of millions of dollars in healthcare cost savings.8 Yet USDA has failed to account for these benefits, or to include any cost-benefit analysis in its proposed rule, despite the requirements Executive Orders 12866 and 13563.
Were USDA to conduct such an analysis, it would demonstrate that the proposed “flexibilities” would not only damage public health and deepen social inequities, they would not be cost-effective. A seven year delay in implementing sodium reduction targets, watering down whole grain standards from 100% to 50% of grains served, and carving out an exemption for chocolate and other flavored milk products, will do little to support struggling school meals programs, while significantly damaging public health. We urge USDA to follow the law and to develop school nutrition standards on the basis of the most recent Dietary Guidelines for Americans.

Docket number: FNS-2020-0038). As a Network of some of the nation’s most effective early childhood schools, we
ensure young children furthest from opportunity have the best possible chance for success in school and life. Our
approach extends beyond the classroom to help children, families and communities thrive, and as such we are
concerned that this rule sustains and makes permanent nutrition standards for whole grains, sodium, and
milk that decrease access to nutritionally-balanced meals for families with incomes below the poverty line.
The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in unprecedented food insecurity rates and health disparities, including in
communities we serve. At a time when so many children and families rely heavily on the National School Lunch and
Breakfast Programs (and associated initiatives) as a critical nutrition resource, our nation’s children need strong,
evidence-based nutrition standards that support their learning, health, and well-being. School meals should be
consistent with the Dietary Guidelines for Americans, including serving whole-grains and limiting sodium and fat.
Additionally, data has shown that pandemic-related food insecurity and health disparities have been even greater
for children and families of color, those who have recently immigrated, and those who are asset-limited/incomeconstrained.
We are concerned that USDA’s proposed rule will disproportionately impact these families’ access
to nutritious meals and, in effect, their physical health.
We oppose this proposal and support the original, evidence-based healthy school meal standards. Research has
shown the positive impact of the original healthy school meal nutrition standards on school food offerings, school
meal disparities, and student nutrition-related outcomes.
In addition, we recommend that USDA extend the comment on this rule to 60 days to accommodate observance of
Winter holidays and ensure that a diverse array of school food stakeholders are able to share their perspectives.
Thank you for consideration of the above comments. For any additional information, please contact Margie Wallen,
VP, National Policy, Start Early, 33 W. Monroe Street, Suite 1200, Chicago, IL 60603, mwallen@startearly.org.

National Farm to School Network respectfully submits comments in response to the U.S. Department of
Agriculture’s (USDA) proposed rule entitled: “Restoration of Milk, Whole Grains, and Sodium
Flexibilities” (85 FR 75241). The proposal would reinstitute the changes to the School Breakfast Program
(SBP) and National School Lunch Program (NSLP) sodium, whole grains, and flavored milk requirements
(83 FR 63775, December 12, 2018).
The mission of the National Farm to School Network (NFSN) is to increase access to local food, gardens,
and nutrition and agriculture education to improve children’s health, strengthen family farms, and
cultivate vibrant communities. NFSN envisions a nation in which farm to school and farm to early care
and education (ECE) are essential components of strong and just local and regional food systems. As the
leader of the farm to school and farm to ECE movement, we advocate for policy and systems change,
facilitate networking opportunities, and offer professional development and resources for food system
leaders. Our network includes partners in all 50 states, Washington, D.C., the U.S. Territories, sovereign
nations, and nationally, an advisory board, national staff, and tens of thousands of farm to school and
ECE supporters. Our partners connect children and communities to where their food comes from,
ultimately shifting to increased consumption of nourishing foods, strengthening school and community
infrastructure and regional food systems, and promoting practices that bolster a more just food system.
We understand that because of intentionally designed policies and systems, some children and families
lack connections to and power in the food system, impacting access to and sovereignty over nourishing
food. In order to break down these barriers, we must correct racial and social inequities and
simultaneously create opportunities for exploited, oppressed, and harmed communities – those
targeted by inequitable systems and policies – to build strong and just local food systems. For more
information, please visit www.farmtoschool.org.
We oppose delaying Sodium Target 2 and eliminating Sodium Target 3, weakening the whole grainrich
standard from 100 to 50 percent of all grains served, and allowing flavored low-fat milk.
Weakened Standards Will Increase Health Disparities
Since the implementation of the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010 (HHFKA), schools have made
tremendous progress towards aligning school meals with the health-promoting dietary pattern
recommended by the Dietary Guidelines for Americans (DGA). This progress has been a significant public meals. Prior to HHFKA, students in more affluent and large schools were more likely to have access to
healthier foods than those in under-funded and small schools.1 A Health Impact Assessment of similar
nutrition standards rollbacks found the additional proposed changes would adversely affect students’
health and academic performance, and that students from low-income families attending schools that
are majority Black or Hispanic and in rural neighborhoods are most likely to be impacted by the
proposed changes (while this study focused on the 2020 proposed rollbacks, it can also be generally
applied to the rollbacks in this proposed rule).2 The target standards for HHFKA implementation reflect
the scientific evidence that a diet rich in whole grains, low in sodium, and with minimal added sugars
reduces the likelihood of hypertension, stroke, diabetes, and heart disease. Loosening these standards
will create greater disparities in access to healthy food for low-income students, with reverberating
health effects. Although Executive Orders 12866 and 13563 require agencies to assess costs and benefits
of regulatory actions and select approaches that maximize net benefits, including the effect on public
health and equity, USDA did not do these assessments for this proposed rule, nor did they consult the
public health or medical communities. Further, USDA has not released the Civil Rights Impact Analysis
for this proposed rule. For many children, school breakfast and lunch may be the only nutritious meals
they receive each day. These unnecessary rollbacks will risk children’s health at a time when lowincome,
rural, and Black and Latino communities are being disproportionately harmed by the ongoing
COVID-19 pandemic.
Sweeping Rule Change is Unnecessary for Vast Majority of Schools
Furthermore, loosening the nutrition standards for whole grains, sodium, and flavored milk is
unnecessary and runs contrary to USDA’s 2019 School Nutrition and Meal Cost Study (SNMCS). This
nationally-representative study found that nutritional quality of school lunches and breakfasts increased
significantly after implementation of HHFKA, and that schools were able to make significant progress on
including whole grains and reducing sodium in just five years.3 The small percentage of schools
requesting waivers from whole grain standards (15 percent as of the Interim Final Rule issued by USDA
in 2018), with some states requesting no waivers at all, indicate that difficulties providing healthier
products represent a small minority of areas, and a small minority of types of products.4 Similarly, a
small minority of school food authorities (13 percent) reported finding the milk standards challenging,
according to USDA’ Special Nutrition Program Operations Study School Year 2013-2014.5 If specific
school food authorities report difficulties with standards, USDA should provide additional training and
technical assistance rather than issuing relaxed standards that will affect all kids.
Focus on What Works
Permanently giving up on offering what is most nourishing for children is not the right solution. Just like
riding a bike, learning something new can take time, and our children – who are our future – deserve
our patience and support. Well-nourished children will thrive in their classroom and communities. Farm
to school and farm to early care and education (ECE) practitioners know the power of nutrition and
agriculture education to shape kids' preferences from an early age. Combining nutrition education with
access to healthy, wholesome fruits, vegetables, proteins, and grains has been a proven method not
only to changing healthy eating habits but also to minimizing plate waste.6,7,8,9 Rather than insisting that
kids' preferences for more sugar or salt are permanently unchangeable, USDA can expand its investment
in and dissemination of proven strategies such as farm to school and ECE.10

Through our advocacy and research, we know that the National School Lunch and School Breakfast Programs are essential, and sometimes the only, access to consistent meals for hundreds of thousands of Nebraskans. The quality of meals served within these programs is critical to the health and well-bring of the students to which they are served and the proposed rule would reduce nutrition requirements making it more difficult for students to get the nutrition they need to lead a healthy and active lifestyle.<br/><br/>The new proposed rule would roll back important aspects of the current, evidence-based school meal nutrition standards and significantly unravel the progress made under the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010. Healthy school meals help combat childhood obesity and improve overall health, particularly for low-income children. USDA&#39;s own research, as well as others&#39;, shows that current school meal standards have improved children&#39;s diet and health. Now, in a time of unprecedented food insecurity rates and health disparities, is not the time for a rollback.<br/><br/>We strongly support maintaining the current evidence-based school nutrition standards to assure that all children have access to foods that support their health, well-being, and learning, irrespective of the school they attend.<br/><br/>Nebraska Appleseed&#39;s conversations with local administrators and nutrition directors have revealed that nutrition leaders in our state are not interested in seeing changes to meal service standards. Many I have spoken to directly shared that when the nutrition standards were initially changed, they got push back from students who were used to the old standard. These same administrators shared that they have now seen a generation of students move through their schools who have known only the nutrition standards currently in place and who eat it just as readily, or even more readily, than the students using the previous standard. Removing the current healthy standard will not support better health and wellness among students who are already accepting of school meals.<br/><br/>Nebraska Appleseed would like to encourage the administration to reconsider this roll back and maintain healthy food standards that support student health and wellbeing.

2020,FNS-2020-0038-2739,,Advocacy,"MAZON: A Jewish Response to Hunger
Dear School Programs Branch:
On behalf of MAZON: A Jewish Response to Hunger, I am writing
today regarding the United States Department of Agriculture’s
(USDA) request for comments regarding the plan to codify three
menu planning flexibilities for milk, whole grains, and sodium. This
proposal would further erode nutrition standards amidst a pandemic,
when the nutirional content of school meals is more important than
ever before.
MAZON vehemently opposes the proposed rule change, which
would decrease the nutrition received by school children, many
of whom rely on school meals as their primary source of healthy
food. As such, this revision must be withdrawn.
Inspired by Jewish values and ideals, MAZON is a national advocacy
organization working to end hunger among people of all faiths and
backgrounds in the United States and Israel. For nearly 35 years,
MAZON has been committed to ensuring that vulnerable people have
access to the resources they need to be able to put food on the table.
MAZON is a leading voice on anti-hunger issues, especially those that
involve low-income populations or problems that have been
previously overlooked or ignored—this includes food insecurity
among currently-serving military families, veterans, single mothers,
seniors, rural communities, Tribal Nations, and college students.
MAZON has particular interest in and expertise concerning federal
nutrition policies and increasing access to nutritious food among the
nation’s most vulnerable. MAZON has over a dozen years of national
leadership in this arena, including participation in the 50th
Anniversary White House Conference on Nutrition and Health;
research and production of a national food bank study assessing the
impact of nutrition policies and processes; leadership of national
nutrition initiatives, including Healthy Options, Healthy Meals,
supported by partners including The California Endowment and Kaiser Permanente; and membership on the expert panel of the Robert Wood
Johnson Foundation Healthy Eating Research project to develop evidencebased
recommendations for nutrition guidelines and the promotion of healthy
foods and beverages in charitable food settings.
MAZON has led national initiatives for more than a decade, aimed at improving
the nutritional quality of food within charitable food system. While food banks
nationwide have made progress toward increasing their offerings of fruits and
vegetables to low-income clients, the percentage of unhealthy junk food
distributed through the charitable food system still remains too high. In fact,
MAZON’s 2018 report, “A Tipping Point: Leveraging Opportunities to Improve
the Nutritional Quality of Food Bank Inventory” revealed that, on average, one
quarter of the inventory distributed by food banks is comprised of beverages
and snack foods that are high in added sugars, sodium, and saturated fat.
Therefore, it is imperative that frontline federal nutrition programs, like school
meals programs, maintain high nutrition standards in order to promote the
health and well-being of our nation’s school kids.
Unlike private charitable responses to food insecurity, the U.S. government has
a foundational duty to promote and protect the public good. USDA’s role as an
administrator of the nation’s school meals means the agency must embrace its
heightened role and responsibility as a steward for vulnerable and/or specially
valued populations, like school children. Therefore it is essential that the food
offered at schools is in the best interest of a child’s health. This is especially
true because, for many children, the food they eat at school is often their only
access to balanced, nutritious meals.
USDA also has a heightened responsibility to uphold and model standards that
are consistent with the public interest and broad social values and goals. The
school meal environment is extremely important for establishing nutritious
dietary patterns early on in a child’s life. As such, the nutritional value of
USDA’s school meals should be consistent with USDA’s dietary guidelines.
Relaxing school meal nutritional standards sends a message that USDA does
not support the dietary guidelines that it sets and claims as a cornerstone of
federal nutrition policy and nutrition education activities. Policy coherence and
compliance across the activities and programs of USDA is necessary for the
agency to maintain credibility and proper functioning, and helps ensure school
children are getting healthy and consistent messages that reinforce good eating
habits that will improve long-term health outcomes.
MAZON strongly opposes this proposal to secure nutrition standards roll backs,
and supports the original, evidence-based healthy school meal standards.
Research has shown the positive impact of the original healthy school meal
nutrition standards on school food offerings, school meal disparities, and
student nutrition-related outcomes.
At the very least, the comment period for this proposal should be extended to
60 days. A truncated comment period over the holiday season appears to be
deliberately designed to stifle public comment. By limiting the comment period
to 30 days, instead of the 60-day period required by law, USDA risks that this
binding and consequential proposal will be inadequately vetted by the public.
In addition to dismissing the important role the people play in the rulemaking
process, the shortened timeline for comments on this proposed change are
contrary to the clear Congressional intent behind the Administrative Procedure
Act (APA).
As the current COVID-19 pandemic highlights the absolute importance of
school meals in the lives of low-income families across the country, now is a
particularly inopportune time to weaken the nutritional value of those meals. It
is imperative that our government privilege the nutrition of schoolchildren
over the whims of politicians and school administrators. This proposed rule
change will certainly harm children who rely on USDA to ensure they are
receiving the nutrition they need to learn and thrive. USDA should not proceed
with this rollback of nutrition standards for milk, whole grains, and sodium.

We fully support the proposal that  of all grains served be whole grain rich.<br/><br/>Gold Creek does not produce milk, so we have no written opinion about the service of low-fat flavored milk.<br/><br/>Regarding the flexibility of sodium, while we commend USDA for the elimination of the final target of sodium reduction, we would request that USDA eliminate Target 2 as well.  Our reasons are listed below.<br/><br/>1.<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Medicals journals have indicated that young people need sodium to help strengthen the bones of their spine and joints.  In fact, until a person is about 25, sodium is stored in the skeletal structure of the body.  The planned Target 2 sodium reduction could have potentially long-term negative health benefits if a child is not able to consume the amount of sodium needed to produce a strong healthy spine.<br/>2.<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Sodium is the second most used spice behind sugar.  While all people should watch their sodium intake, it should be done in moderation.  Target 2 is a 23.98% reduction of Target 1.  It has taken 8 years for students to begin to accept the lower sodium amounts in product.  Target 2 will cause additional hardships.<br/>3.<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>In this current pandemic time, it has become overwhelmingly apparent that Child Nutrition has been a true savior for the youth of our country.  The meals that have been put together and served to our students since March is unprecedented and staggering in the quantity.  At this point, it is about serving a child food where they might not have that option with their current family situation.  We know schools are offering healthy, nutritious meals.  We think that this is the time for USDA to assist schools in providing meals to help the youth of our county be less food insecure.  Worrying about the sodium level in a meal, in the whole scope of the things, is very low on the priority list.<br/>4.<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Providing food to the K-12 segment is not easy for a manufacturer.  There are many requirements and regulations that must be followed.  Many companies see these regulations as being overly restrictive and thus have chosen the option of not partnering with the various K-12 school districts.  If USDA continues to push for lower sodium targets beyond what is currently established and accepted in the overall foodservice area, the number of manufacturers who leave the school segment will increase.  Reduction in companies that produce products for the K-12 segment will reduce competition, increase prices, and could lead to larger shortage and production problems.  USDA needs to encourage manufacturers to want to be a part of the feeding of our youth.  Enacting Target 2 will only encourage more companies to either leave the segment or not even enter the arena.<br/>5.<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>If Target 2 becomes enacted, manufacturers will have to begin reformulating in 2022 to develop limits that will allow the product to meet the standards in 2024.  Ultimately, the decrease in sodium will have dramatic impacts on acceptability by the students and on how some products perform (example cheese).  Ultimately, districts will see a drop in participation again starting in 2024 when the ""reformulated products"" are what is being served.<br/>6.<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Since 1990, the breakdown of who is buying school lunch has dramatically shifted.  In 1990, approximately 60% of all students ate school lunch.  In 2020, that percentage remains about the same.  However, who is buying a school lunch has changed significantly.  In 1990, over 50% of paid students purchased a lunch in school.  Today, that number has dropped to little over 25%.  The bulk of students buying school lunch are the free and reduced students.  If the desire is to continue to grow the school breakfast and lunch program, then the students who are not eligible for a free meal need to be sought out.  A way of capturing those students is offering the high-quality products that mimic what is seen in restaurants.  Thus, if the Target 2 sodium level is enacted, this will push more ""paid"" students away from the program.<br/><br/>If you have questions or comments about our comments, please contact Jack Crawford at jack.crawford@goldcreekfoods.com or at 770-570-6098.<br/><br/>",In favor of original HHFKA

Food and Nutrition Service (FNS)
FNS-2020-0038-0001
United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)
December 23, 2020
My name is Eric Adams and I am the Brooklyn Borough President, representing nearly 2.6 million residents in what would be the fourth largest city in America if it was an independent city. Within this borough are 575 schools serving 342,332 students, many of whom come from low-income and underserved communities.
The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)’s recent proposal to roll back nutrition requirements in schools, also referred to as “meal flexibilities,” devalues the health of our children. This proposal, which would increase access to one percent chocolate milk in schools, cut whole-grain serving requirements in half, and give nutrition directors more time to meet weakened sodium reduction targets, denies the critical reality that better nutrition is required to ensure better health outcomes. While the proposal states that these “changes respond directly to the needs of nutrition professionals who are the experts on-the-ground, hearing from our children every day,” the USDA’s own data contradicts both the implied increase in food waste and the notion that children are declining healthier, plant-forward meals. The lack of science behind this rulemaking belies its purpose. The proposal is a last ditch attempt to reinforce the current administration’s ties to the dairy, meat, grain, and sugar industries, which prioritize profit over people.
The profits that sugar, grain, and dairy industries stand to make from this proposal come at an enormous cost to the typical taxpayer. Prior to the pandemic, health care costs associated with chronic disease constituted approximately 10 percent of our gross domestic product (GDP). The pandemic has only exacerbated our inability to decrease this burden, fostering harms from food insecurity, obesity, and diet-related chronic disease, and the impact of these conditions while infected with COVID-19. The novel coronavirus’ disproportionate devastation of populations living with obesity and/or chronic disease is indisputable: Previous diagnosis with obesity increases the risk of being hospitalized with COVID-19 by more than two-fold and increases the risk of dying by 48 percent. Two thirds of Americans are overweight or obese, but obesity and/or chronic disease, correlative risks of contracting COVID-19 and the fastest rising rates of food insecurity, disproportionately affect people of color. While this proposal demonstrates a flagrant disregard for the health of all Americans, it blatantly denies communities of color, already suffering from centuries of systemic racism, the right to survive, both current and ongoing pandemics.
Nutritionally insecure children and adults are reliant on the food produced by school cafeterias: in New York City alone, our estimates show that the number of hungry New Yorkers we feed through our grab and go program has doubled since the start of the pandemic. The current proposal would restore milk, whole grain, and sodium flexibilities. Foods high in added sugars, such as one percent chocolate milk, are synonymous with increased risk for developing obesity.1 Additionally, growing evidence links dairy milk consumption to increased prostate2 and breast3 cancer risk. A diet high in whole grains and low in processed grains lowers the risk for colon cancer4 and Type 2 diabetes5. By allowing high sodium content in foods, we are playing with children’s futures (high sodium intake increases risk of hypertension, which in turn elevates risk for atrial fibrillation, stroke, and/or aortic dissection) and development of learned, unfavorable food preferences. Rather than scaling back nutrition guidelines that affect our children’s health, why not increase plant-forward menu options, which scientists, doctors, and dieticians have shown improve longevity and quality-of-life in the long term, and help to prevent chronic disease? Working hard to feed everyone means working hard to feed everyone well. Nutritionally negligent products and predatory industry practices should not dictate school menus.
This proposal devalues the health of our people and the planet. If passed it would work against the nutritional changes implemented in Brooklyn public schools — changes already benefiting our communities’ health. I want everyone receiving a school lunch in America to experience what is increasingly possible in my community: the provision of nutritious foods in schools. We limit our children’s lives when we sentence them to a diet scientifically proven to increase preventable causes of death.

Instead he has made it a point to do away with all of our rules, and laws that protect us. It is time for this agency to stand up to Trump and let him know that the people are fighting back, and we will not be silenced. <br/><br/>[RE: USDA Docket ID FNS-2020-0038]",In favor of original HHFKA
2020,FNS-2020-0038-2753,,Advocacy,"Dear School Program Branch:<br/><br/>The Greater Chicago Food Depository strongly opposes the U.S. Department of Agriculture&rsquo;s (USDA) proposed rule on codifying lowered nutrition standards for the National School Lunch Program and the School Breakfast Program. If finalized, this rule would weaken school nutrition standards for millions of American children.<br/><br/>The nutritional quality of school lunches and breakfasts is important as we work to ensure all children &ndash; especially low-income children &ndash; have access to both enough food and nutritious food. Unfortunately, many American children do not have consistent access to nutritious or adequate amounts of food. One in four U.S. children is at-risk of hunger and one in three is obese or overweight. Because many children consume as many as half their daily calories at school, making healthy food more accessible through the school meal programs will help improve nutrition and reduce obesity for millions of school-aged children. <br/><br/>Healthier meals at school not only improve children&rsquo;s health and reduce obesity, they can also increase academic achievement. The lack of adequate nutrition negatively affects cognitive and behavioral development in children.  Children with inadequate or poor nutrition are more likely to perform poorly on tests, and the resulting learning deficits have a cumulative effect as children continue through elementary school and beyond. <br/><br/>If finalized, this rollback would jeopardize the progress schools have made to provide healthier food to students. USDA&rsquo;s own data from the School Nutrition and Meal Cost Study found that the nutritional quality of school meals has significantly increased, participation is highest in schools with the healthiest meals, and plate waste has not increased as school meals have become healthier. This proposed rule would codify weakened nutrition standards and rollback this important progress. We urge USDA to put kids first.

Therefore, I am disappointed by the USDA&#39;s decision to once again propose a rule that would continue the rollback of healthy nutrition standards for school meals. This last-ditch effort to sustain existing rollbacks will make weaker nutrition standards for whole grains, sodium, and milk permanent. <br/><br/>School food programs also support the American farmers who grow the food that is included in school breakfast and lunch programs. This is particularly harmful to small farmers, who like many businesses are suffering from the pandemic. The food supply chains have been disrupted, making it harder for farmers to sell their produce--this is not the time for the Department of Agriculture to take away another piece of the market for farm produce.<br/><br/>Especially now, with unprecedented rates of food insecurity,, our nation&#39;s children need strong, evidence-based nutrition standards that support their learning, health, and well-being.  School meals should be consistent with the Dietary Guidelines for Americans, including serving whole grains and limiting sodium and fat.<br/><br/>Making sure that children get enough to eat is one of the most effective, and cost-effective, way to improve their lives and their life-long earning potential. Well-nourished children are also less likely to become sick, from all causes, and they recover faster from illness and injury.<br/><br/>I strongly oppose this proposal to make the lower nutrition standards permanent, and support the original, evidence-based healthy school meal standards. Research has shown the positive impact of the original healthy school meal nutrition standards on school food offerings, school meal disparities, and student nutrition-related outcomes.<br/><br/>Also, USDA should extend the comment period on this proposal to 60 days.

I obtained a degree in nutrition and dietetics from California Polytechnic State University, Pomona and I am currently completing my dietetic internship to become a registered dietitian. I recently completed over 520 hours of supervised practice at Downey Unified School District (DUSD) during the COVID-19 pandemic to support my community in providing nutritious meals to all children 18 and under. At this moment, I am interning at PHFE WIC in Santa Ana, educating mothers and children about health and wellness. Through my past and current experiences, I have seen how significant a child&#39;s nutrition is to parents/caregivers. <br/><br/>Flexibilities in sodium, milk, and whole grains in school meals undermine an effective strategy to improve the health of our children. The taste preference for salt is developed at an early age. Children are exposed to high sodium foods at home, school, restaurants, and fast-food eateries, which clarifies the extremity that 90% of children in the United States ages 6-18 years eat an additional 1,000 mg of sodium per day before salt is added to the table.1 Consequently, nearly 17% of children ages 8-17 years have raised blood pressure, increasing their risk for heart disease and stroke.2 Since children that participate in the School Breakfast Program and National School Lunch Program are consuming more than 45% of the daily recommended sodium it is crucial to implement the sodium target 2 without the delay of four years to improve and reduce the number of children at risk for chronic diseases. <br/><br/>The milk flexibilities to allow schools to serve flavored low-fat and/or fat-free milk should not be implemented. ""Flavored milk is not nutritionally equivalent to unflavored milk. It is significantly higher in calories, sugar, and sodium and usually contains artificial colors and flavors.""3 Flavored milk should be offered on special occasions as a treat to reduce the overall added sugar and additives in a child&#39;s diet.4 Recent research has indicated consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages are associated with childhood obesity.5<br/><br/>I am eager to see the adjustments made in the flexibilities of milk, whole grains, and sodium standards in the NSLP, SBP, SMP, and CACFP to provide healthier meals and standards for our children&#39;s health and wellness.<br/><br/>I thank you for your consideration.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/><br/>Alexandra Magallon<br/>Utah State University Dietetic Intern<br/>Salt Lake City, UT<br/><br/>_____________________________________________________________________________________<br/><br/>1.

2020,FNS-2020-0038-2764,,Academic researchers,"University of California’s Nutrition Policy Institute (NPI) respectfully submits this comment in strong opposition to the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) proposed rule entitled: “Restoration of Milk, Whole Grains, and Sodium Flexibilities” (85 FR 75241). The proposed rule seeks to institute the changes to the School Breakfast Program (SBP) and National School Lunch Program (NSLP) sodium, whole grains, and flavored milk requirements put forward in 83 FR 63775 (December 12, 2018).
For over 20 years, NPI and its predecessor Center for Weight and Health have engaged in nutrition research to strengthen public policy in order to improve people’s diets, health and opportunity to lead a productive life. NPI follows the science in recognizing the efficacy of prevention rather than treatment, and in focusing on infants and children as the most promising age group to benefit from improved nutrition. Realizing that determinants of health already adversely target low-income children and children of color to experience poorer nutrition outcomes, NPI directs much of its work to strengthening the federal child nutrition programs upon which these same children depend for much of their daily intake. Importantly, excessive weight in childhood has been shown to be difficult to reverse as the life cycle continues. And if current trends continue, nearly half of all US adults age 18 and over is expected to have obesity by 2030 with nearly a quarter, 24.2 percent, severely obese.1 This trend must be countered with every available strategy. Because the National School Lunch Program (NSLP) and School Breakfast Program (SBP) serve as many as 30 million children each school day, and low-income children are the predominant participants in these two programs, NPI focuses much of its research on and has gained most familiarity with the school-age nutrition assistance programs.
In addition, this current COVID-19 period with its concomitant economic fallout increases still more the critical importance of the NSLP and SBP. The programs are serving a growing number of children whose families’ likely unemployment may put them at nutritional risk. In addition, due to school closures, many children have fewer opportunities for physical activity and may be gaining excessive weight, as characteristically happens when school is not in session. Because the school meal programs are aligned with the Dietary Guidelines for Americans, they have been shown to be effective in protecting children from both food insecurity and excessive weight gain.
NPI is pleased to adopt the reasoning and outcome described in Center for Science in the Public Interest’s comment opposing this proposed rule. In this comment, we hone in on the portion of the proposed rule regarding flavored milk, as that is the area in which NPI has extensive expertise. Regarding the desirability of USDA’s proposal to permit flavoring of low-fat as well as nonfat milk, CSPI said:
Allowing schools to serve flavored low-fat milk would be inconsistent with expert nutrition recommendations based on the National Academy of Medicine’s 2009 report2 and the 2015 DGA.3 Similarly, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation’s Healthier Beverage Guidelines recommend only plain fat-free and low-fat milk for children and adolescents.4
NPI researchers, together with colleagues from the University of California, Berkeley, School of Public Health, have published a very recent study on the impact of removing chocolate milk from the school lunch program.5 The study examined the effects of removing chocolate milk as part of efforts to reduce added sugar from the lunch program at middle and high schools in the San Francisco Unified School District during the 2017-18 school year. The study assessed the effect of chocolate milk removal policy on student milk selection, waste, and overall consumption and to estimate attendant changes in calcium, protein, vitamin D, and added sugar intake among racially/ethnically and socioeconomically diverse secondary school students. The study found that, despite a slight decrease in student milk consumption after the policy was passed, student intake of milk’s key nutrients -- calcium, protein, and vitamin D -- were not reduced, nor was there any increase in milk waste. Furthermore, students’ consumption of added sugar from milk declined significantly, thus achieving the district’s purpose in removing chocolate milk. USDA’s proposed rule thus would defeat the policy goal of reducing added sugars in children’s diets by decreasing availability of flavored milk and other sugar-sweetened beverages. Sugar-sweetened beverages are the largest single source of added sugars in children’s diets and are causally linked to type 2 diabetes, obesity, cardiovascular disease, and dental caries.
UC Nutrition Policy Institute opposes USDA’s proposed rule to return flavored milk to school cafeterias. To re-introduce chocolate milk when its absence has worked so well to lower consumption of added sugars is contrary to science. Further, the rule’s timing would deprive policy makers of the benefits of the imminent 2020-25 Dietary Guidelines, require COVID-impacted schools to make an operational change when they are most beleaguered, and needlessly expose children again to additional calories from added sugars consumption. For the health of US children, it is critical to do more to improve nutrition, not less.

2020,FNS-2020-0038-2765,,School,"I am a retired teacher and for the last 9 years I have represented the fifth district on the Mendocino County School Board. My wife taught nutrition for ten years in the public schools and for a number of years has taught health classes for Mendocino County Public Health. I consider myself to be well informed on the science of nutrition and human health. Thank you for this opportunity to comment on the Restoration of Milk, Whole Grains, and Sodium Flexibilities.<br/><br/>It is well established that whole grains are more nutritious than white flour and the increased fiber is beneficial to human health. You are definitely on the right track here.<br/><br/>It is also certain that limitations on sodium intake are necessary to avoid long term negative impacts on health. Taste can be enhanced with beneficial spices and herbs.<br/><br/>The dairy question is my primary concern here. With a large segment of our young people suffering from the chronic disease of obesity it is clearly wise to offer low-fat milk. Whole Milk is 50% fat and fat has twice the calories of a comparable amount of sugar.  However, sugar is also a matter of concern. Flavored milk usually means chocolate milk and it is most often heavily sugared. Since there is no mention of sugar in you document I will give you the benefit of the doubt, and assume you have dealt with it elsewhere. I would encourage you to state restrictions on sugar amounts in flavored milk here again.<br/><br/>While I have your attention I would like to share my concerns about the issue of serving milk in schools where a significant proportion pf the students are lactose intolerant. This is a classic example of Institutionalized racism that can have a negative impact om the health of young people. To better explain it I am including a communication I sent to the Mendocino County Superintendent of schools:<br/><br/>Hello Michelle,<br/>I appreciated your guest commentary in the Mendocino Beacon June 4, 2020 on ""Recognizing our own bias"" and your encouragement to do something. Therefore, I am answering your ""call to action"" by calling your attention to a problem of institutionalized racism that exits in most of our public schools. It has to do with serving only dairy milk in school cafeterias. As you may know humans are the only mammals that drink the milk of other mammals and continue to drink milk into adulthood. But not all humans can do it since most people in the world do not continue to produce lactase, the enzyme designed for digesting lactose (milk sugars) into adulthood. Producing lactase into adulthood is a consequence of a genetic mutation unique to most northern Europeans and a few tribes in Africa. To put it bluntly, consuming dairy products is primarily a white people&#39;s thing to do.<br/><br/>People who don&#39;t produce lactase  are called ""lactose intolerant"". The incidence of lactose intolerance among different races varies greatly. For Caucasians it is around 33%, Hispanics 53-58%, African Americans 70-75%, Native Americans 70-78%, and Asians 95-98%. Clearly, serving dairy products in school meals has a Caucasian bias and has detrimental effects on the majority of our minority students who are not minorities in many of our schools. These numbers and opinions are derived from a brilliant doctor by the name of Milton Mills. He explains it all better than me in this link to one of his presentations:   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sKzUD8eFb0E<br/><br/>There is an easy solution in that many plant based milks have come on the market in recent years and at least one of these should be offered as a nondairy option. I would recommend we follow the advice of the grand jury and contract with a dietician to review the available products and make a recommendation for offering students an option. I have encountered and been highly impressed with the dieticians at the Adventist hospital in Willits.<br/><br/>I must admit I have a personal bias against the dairy industry since drinking milk in my high school and college days had a very negative effect on my athletic performance. I even had my tonsils taken out, to no avail, my freshman year in college. In retrospect it is easy to see I was becoming lactose intolerant. I also have a grandson with a Mexican father who threw up cow&#39;s milk the first time he drank it and would probably do the same today. I once asked him if the school cafeteria offered any options to dairy milk and he said, ""No, and they force me to take a milk"". I worry about how little kids interpret this situation, particularly when the walls are often covered with ""Got Milk"" posters. <br/><br/>Thanks for your time and any consideration given.

2020,FNS-2020-0038-2769,,Advocacy,"Thank you for the opportunity to comment on the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) Proposed Rule, “Restoration of Milk, Whole Grains, and Sodium Flexibilities” published in the Federal Register on November 25, 2020. On behalf of Children’s HealthWatch, a network of pediatricians, public health researchers, and policy and child health experts, please accept these comments and our strong opposition to the proposed changes that will weaken nutrition standards and the quality of meals offered in schools, and thus negatively affect the health of children.
The mission of Children’s HealthWatch is to improve the health and development of young children by informing policies that address and alleviate economic hardships. We accomplish this mission by interviewing caregivers of young children on the frontlines of pediatric care, in urban emergency departments and primary care clinics in five cities: Boston, Minneapolis, Little Rock, Baltimore, and Philadelphia. Since 1998, we have conducted more than 70,000 interviews with caregivers, and analyzed data from those interviews to assess the impact of public policies on the health and development of young children.
Consistent access to nutritious foods is essential for the health and development of children. Child nutrition programs, including the National School Lunch Program (NSLP) and School Breakfast Program (SBP), are key vehicles for delivering nutritious food to children, particularly serving those from families with low incomes that may struggle to otherwise afford healthy food. As such, it is imperative that the USDA maintain healthy nutrition standards for school meals, including consistent alignment with the Dietary Guidelines for Americans for serving whole-grains and limiting sodium and fat.
Nutritious school meals sustain health and prepare children to learn
The NSLP and SBP feed 30 million children healthy meals each school day across the country. Research shows NSLP and SBP are associated with numerous benefits for children including improved test scores,1 lower rates of absences and tardiness,2,3,4 improved dietary intake,5,6 and lower risk of obesity.7
While the research of Children’s HealthWatch focuses on young children not yet in school, we know that infants and toddlers live within the context of families, many of whom have older siblings. The NSLP and SBP not only ensure that school-age children eat a nutritious breakfast and lunch, they also have a positive effect on families. These programs alleviate pressure on often-constrained family food budgets; saving money on up to 10 meals each week during the school year for their children, parents are enabled are able to better afford meals at home and on the weekends. This means, and research has shown, that the NSLP and SBP are effective in reducing household food insecurity.8
Children typically consume up to half of their daily calories at school and for some children, the meals they eat at school may be the only meals they eat in a day. This is why evidence-based meal standards that are age appropriate for growing bodies and brains are necessary. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) applauded Congress in 2010 for the steps it took to align school meal standards with solid nutrition science. These standards, passed in the Healthy Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010 (HHFKA), reflect the Dietary Guidelines for Americans and the recommendations of the AAP and ensure children are eating more fruits, vegetables, lower fat milk, less sodium and more whole grains in their daily diets. In addition to the direct nutrition benefits, the evidence-based standards from 2010 are estimated to prevent more than 2 million children from becoming obese, saving our country up to $792 million in avoidable health-care costs over a ten year period.9 Evaluation of the impact of the improved standards is also emerging and positive. Research has shown that as a result of the updated standards, children are eating more fruits and vegetables and their overall dietary quality has improved.10 A recent report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on sodium reduction in schools found an 11 percent decrease in sodium content in the meals served and underscored that a comprehensive approach to healthier diets through reduced sodium is feasible.11 Given the wealth of evidence on the need to increase intake of nutritious foods for healthy weights and prevention of chronic illnesses during childhood, it is critical that the FNS retain the progress made to improve these standard, rather than attempt to rollback these provisions.
Despite the science and cost savings behind these standards, the USDA proposed in 2017 and finalized the following year a rule (Child Nutrition Programs: Flexibilities for Milk, Whole Grains, and Sodium Requirements) that rolled back these critical criteria. This rule has since been vacated and remanded by the courts. Even with this court ruling, the proposed rule seeks to again roll back these criteria by targeting changes to roll back standards around serving whole grains and limiting sodium and fat. Specifically, this second attempt to weaken nutrition standards will scale back whole-grain requirements by reducing the original standard that 100 percent of all grains served in school meals are whole-grain-rich to only 50 percent, and will continue to delay the requirement to further lower sodium levels in school meals.
School meals should be consistent with the Dietary Guidelines for Americans, including serving whole-grain foods and limiting sodium and saturated fat. This is especially important because most American children, especially those from low income families, do not consume enough fiber and whole grains, and consume too much sodium and fat. Further, milk deserves special mention here because of the important nutrients it contains, such as calcium and vitamin D, which are very important for healthy growth and development of children. However, low-fat or fat-free unflavored milk is preferable to avoid unnecessary fat and calories in children’s diets.12 In a country where obesity affects nearly one in five children, and places children at greater risk of cardiovascular disease and diabetes, healthy school meals are necessary for reversing this concerning health trend.13
At a time of unprecedented food insecurity rates and health disparities, our nation’s children need strong, evidence-based school nutrition standards that support their learning, health, and well-being. Yet, if finalized, this rule will make permanent weaker nutrition standards for whole grains, sodium, and milk, and continue to roll back the healthy nutrition standards for school meals that are critical for child health and development. As pediatricians and public health researchers, we are gravely concerned about the impact this will have on children's health. Therefore, we strongly oppose this regulatory action that would harm the health of children and their families, and urge the administration to immediately withdraw this proposal in its entirety.

2020,FNS-2020-0038-2770,,Constituent,"Dear Secretary Perdue:<br/><br/>I oppose your proposal to weaken school nutrition standards. The importance of healthy school meals has taken on new urgency during the ongoing coronavirus outbreak. Given the severe economic impacts of COVID-19, more children will likely continue to qualify for free or reduced-priced school meals. For many of these children, school breakfast and lunch may be the only nutritious meals they consume in a day.<br/><br/>The seven-year delay of the second sodium-reduction targets and the elimination of the third targets would lock in unsafe levels of sodium. Many schools and food service companies are working toward or already providing healthy and appealing meals with less salt. Any remaining challenges can be addressed through technical assistance.<br/><br/>Cutting whole grains by half would also harm children&#39;s health. Kids on average consume not enough whole grain and too much refined grain. And eating more whole grains is associated with reduced risk of heart disease, stroke, and diabetes, provides more nutrients, and are a healthful source of fiber. Before the pandemic, virtually all schools (85 percent) were already providing kids with appealing and tasty whole-grain options. Why allow this progress to be reversed?<br/><br/>Schools already have plenty of chocolate milk, and the current standards limit it to the non-fat variety to curb calories. This proposal instead violates expert dietary recommendations and opens the door for more-caloric flavored milks, which means more fat and more added sugar in kids&#39; diets. <br/><br/>Finally, these nutrition standards are supposed to be based on the Dietary Guidelines for Americans which are expected to be released in a matter of weeks.

2020,FNS-2020-0038-2771,,Constituent,"Dear Ms. Tina Namian,
I struggled with childhood obesity and was often reliant on school meals to meet my nutritional
needs during my youth. Meal choices were rich in refined grains and sugars at school, which contributed
to a chronic medical condition. School lunches can set a precedent of what wholesome meals should be
comprised of, while also reducing long term medical risks. I am writing to oppose the Food and
Nutrition Service (FNS) proposed rule, “Restoration of Milk, Whole Grains and Sodium Flexibilities,”
which was posted on November 25, 2020 relating to 7 CFR Parts 210, 215, 220, and 226.
The Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act (NSLA) requires that school meals are
consistent with the goals of the latest Dietary Guidelines for Americans1. Further, Section 201 of Public
Law 111-296 amended Section 4(b) of the NSLA, requires FNS to update the meal patterns and
nutrition standards for school meals based on recommendations in a report issued by the Health and
Medicine Division of the National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine2.
A majority of the U.S. House of Representatives and each of the U.S. Senate members voted in
favor the aforementioned actions. The intent of Congress regarding these acts was to improve the quality
of meals provided to students based on scientific and medical evidence in order to improve health
outcomes. Both the APA and the Constitution indicate that an agency's actions are found to be arbitrary Americans.” The most iteration of this report issues the stern warning that “a history of poor eating and
physical activity patterns have a cumulative effect and have contributed to significant nutrition- and
physical activity-related health challenges that now face the U.S. population.”8 Section a(2), under basis
of guidelines, states “The information and guidelines contained in each report required under paragraph
(1) shall be based on the preponderance of the scientific and medical knowledge with is current at the
time the report is prepared.”
The Healthy, Hunger-free Kids Act of 2010 final rule regarding nutrition standards in the
National School Lunch and School Breakfast Programs uses this same report as standard practice to
enhance the diet and health of children and help mitigate the childhood obesity trend. As NSLA is
written and passed into law by Congress, the factor Congress intended to consider as the basis for 7 CFR
Parts 210, 215, 220, and 216 are scientifically and medically based dietary guidelines as published by the
National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine.
The U.S. Surgeon General released a Call to Action to Control Hypertension on October 20,
2020. This call to action necessitates improved diet quality, including the addition of nutrient dense food
and the reduction of salt. Life expectancy in the United States peaked in 2014, and the leading cause of
death, according to the CDC, is cardiovascular disease9. Cardiovascular disease and obesity are directly
related, in many instances, to suboptimal dietary intake. According to the National Center for Health
Statistics, obesity is an increasing concern for Americans impacting 30% of adults and nearly 15% of
adolescents (grades 9-12) in 201810. The proposed rule would endanger the health of children as it
relaxes measures necessary to curb increasing adverse health outcomes related to dietary intake.
The “Restoration of Milk, Whole Grains, and Sodium Flexibilities” rule proposed by the FNS
beyond the initial intended scope delineated in NSLA and Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010.
Reliance on factors such as student taste preferences, operational flexibilities, and the role of product
innovation are arbitrary and rely on factors that Congress did not intend for consideration. Passing this
proposed rule will invite future litigation, which on the basis of the APA, U.S. Constitution and federal
court findings will find Congress’ actions to be arbitrary. Given the increasing prevalence of obesity and
cardiovascular disease killing more Americans than anything else, it is prudent to honor the initial
intention of NSLA to base nutritional guidance on science and medicine. Schools are fundamental
influencing children’s worldview and serve to be educational. We must prioritize utilizing science and
medicine inform our practices and to promote healthy eating behaviors.

2020,FNS-2020-0038-2782,,Advocacy,"Dear Ms. Namian:
I am writing on behalf of the 180,000 advocates at the National Council of Jewish Women (NCJW) to oppose the United States Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) proposed rule that would continue the rollback of healthy nutrition standards for school meals. As this administration draws to a close, in the middle of a pandemic, this last minute effort to sustain existing rollbacks would make permanent weaker nutrition standards for whole grains, sodium, and milk. As such, this rule would lead to unhealthy school meal consumption across the country.
Founded in 1893, NCJW is the oldest Jewish women’s volunteer organization in the United States. Inspired by Jewish values, NCJW strives for social justice by improving the quality of life for women, children, and families and by safeguarding individual rights and freedoms. Our grassroots advocates carry out the organization’s long tradition of progressive action through a powerful combination of community organizing, education, direct service, and advocacy. With 60 sections (chapters) across the country as well as a strong State Policy Advocacy network in 16 states, NCJW works on local, state, and federal issues.
Schools began implementing a nutrition standard rollback as a result of a 2018 USDA rule, unraveling the original standards established under the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010.1 The USDA had to reverse this rollback due to the agency’s failure to follow the law when first promulgating this final rule when it went into effect.2 In 2017 when the rule was first introduced, more than 80,000 individuals and organizations urged the USDA to maintain the current, evidence-based nutrition standards.3 During the public comment period of the interim rule, 96 percent of commenters opposed changes to the nutrition standards, stating that such “flexibilities are not needed” because there is already “widespread compliance with existing standards.”4 The Trump Administration is now pushing this damaging rule again in this lame-duck period with little regard for public opinion, the voices of families, or research and science that would suggest removing the rule.5
NCJW works to ensure comprehensive supports, opportunities, services, and policies that enable all children and youth to succeed in school. This includes nutritional meals at school, upon which the vast majority of schools — approximately 95 percent — participate in the National School Lunch Program, providing more than 30 million children with free and reduced price-meals.6 Indeed, over 11 million children live in food-insecure homes.7 Schools play an important role in shaping lifelong healthy eating habits by offering nutritious meals through federal child nutrition programs.8 That is why children who rely on school meals — among the neediest in this country — must be provided with the highest nutritional standards. We know from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that students learn better eating habits when schools provide healthy foods. However, the proposed rule removes the assurance of nutritional meals to the millions of students who rely on schools for their meals each day.
Due to COVID-19, our country is experiencing unprecedented food insecurity rates and health disparities. And, those who are obese are at greater risk of illness and death from the disease, with children among the last in line for the vaccine.9 Now more than ever, our nation’s children need strong, evidence-based nutrition standards that support their learning, health, and well-being. Yet, despite living in a country with an abundance of fresh produce, a mere 9 percent of high school students meet the US Dietary Guidelines for fruit, and only 2 percent eat enough vegetables.10 In Illinois, where NCJW has two sections, even the students themselves revolted against the unhealthy rotation of hamburgers, chicken patties, and pizza in the Chicago Public Schools system.11 If young students can recognize the importance of nutritional lunches, it is hard to understand why the USDA does not. School meals should be consistent with the Dietary Guidelines for Americans, including serving whole-grains and limiting sodium and fat.
In addition, USDA should extend the comment period to 60 days, which is the typical period of time to comment on a proposed rule. Shortening the allowable time to comment to 30 days — in the waning days of the administration, in the middle of a pandemic, and over the holidays — is a clear attempt to railroad this damaging rule to keep the public from weighing in.
Our Jewish texts and traditions command us again and again to feed the hungry, care for the poor, and safeguard those who are most vulnerable — to not “harden [our] heart[s] or shut [our] hand[s] against [our] poor brethren” in need (Deuteronomy 15:7). We believe each person is made in the image of God, and we are all responsible for one another, particularly in the darkest times. These are those times.
NCJW strongly opposes this proposal to secure nutrition standards changes, and supports the original, evidence-based healthy school meal standards. Research has shown the positive impact of the original healthy school meal nutrition standards on school food offerings, school meal disparities, and student nutrition-related outcomes.
Thank you for the opportunity to comment on this critical issue.

2020,FNS-2020-0038-2794,,Advocacy,"To Ms. Namian,
Project Bread respectfully  submits the following comments in response to the proposed rules on ""Restoration of Milk,Whole Grains,and Sodium Flexibilities"". From our experience working with schools and families,we believe strongly that school nutrition standards should follow evidence based nutrition. Hungry students,including the over
491.000 students who ate school lunch daily in Massachusetts,pre-pandemic,deserve
to be served the healthiest meals possible at school. We urge the USDA to maintain the current standards and targets for child nutrition  programs to ensure healthy meals for children who rely on school meals by rescinding this proposed rule.
Project Bread is a state-wide  anti-hunger organization in Massachusetts that connects people and communities to accessible, healthy,and reliable sources of food. Before the pandemic,nearly 1 in 10 children were food insecure,but using data from the Census Bureau's Household Pulse Survey, we now estimate nearly 1 in 5 children live in a household experiencing food insecurity. As a result,our  organizational mission is deeply tied to the success of the child nutrition programs such as the School Breakfast Program (SBPl and the National School Lunch Program (NSLPl. Project Bread. In partnership with the Massachusetts Department of Elementary and Secondary Education, Project Bread operates the Child Nutrition Outreach Program (CNOP) and up until recently the Chefs
in Schools Program (CIS), now known as Community Nutrition Services.
For over twenty years,CNOP has worked to increase access and participation in school breakfast and summer meals, two underutilized federal nutrition programs, through technical assistance and promotional outreach. We recognize improving access is paramount. However,maintaining high quality standards is essential both to increasing access as well as ensuring the nutrients consumed during the school day provide the best fuel for active learning and healthy lives.
For over a decade, CIS has worked with cafeteria staff to produce meals from scratch that meet high nutrition standards,maintain labor costs,and decrease plate waste. We know firsthand it is possible to meet or exceed the new nutrition standards while producing delicious, kid-friendly meals.
We know dietary behaviors established in childhood have a profound impact on lifelong health,and for many low-income children,55% or more of their daily nutrients come from school meals. For these children especially,school meals provide vital nutrition required to learn, grow and thrive. To this end,improving the quality of school meals has been a focus of Project Bread's work for over two decades. The Healthy,Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010 (HHFKA) was an incredible step forward in ensuring wider adoption of more nutritious school meals and developing lifelong healthy eating for participating students.
Across the nation,before the pandemic,nearly  30 million children ate lunch at school every day;more than 21 million of them are low-income children whose families are struggling to make ends meet. Nearly 15 million children (12 million of them low-income) ate school breakfast every day. Research shows that the new standards have had a positive impact on the school nutrition environment  as well as student food selection and consumption.
That is why we are deeply concerned about the proposed changes to the school nutrition standards and strongly support maintaining the current, evidence-based school meal program standards which assure that all children have access to foods that support their health and wellbeing.
Healthy Meals Do Not Lead to Plate Waste
Before addressing the specific changes proposed  by USDA, we must address the myth that healthy meals lead to an increase in plate waste and meal costs. The research and our experience show this is simply not true. While results vary among school districts across the country. we know higher standards paired with the commitment of school nutrition professionals can and do lead to children eating the same amount or greater amounts of healthier meals than they do with less healthy meals.
The USDA's own School Nutrition and Meal Cost Study released in April 2019 found:
• Rates of plate waste were ""comparable to findings that examined plate waste prior to implementation of the updated nutrition standards.""
• Schools with higher Healthy Eating Index (HEll scores were shown to have higher participation in NSLP. ""Rates of student participation were significantly higher in schools with HEI-2010 scores in the third and highest quartiles (that is,the top halfl of the distribution compared to the lowest quartile.""
• The healthfulness of meals, as measured by the HEI,is not correlated with the districts' costs.
The ""mean reported costs per lunch were not significantly higher in schools that prepared more nutritious meals than in schools that produced the least nutritious meals:·;
In addition to USDA's findings,Project Bread in partnership with Dr. Julia Cohen at the Harvard School of Public Health conducted a series of plate waste studies that proved the new standards lead to healthy consumptions habits among students without increased waste.
The first ran before and after the implementation of the USDA's improved nutrition standards in 2012. The new standards led to increased consumption of entrees (15.6%), vegetables (16.2%). and fruit consumption remained the same.ii These results came from the control group of schools from the original research,proving that no intervention was needed to prevent greater plate waste. On the contrary,students readily accepted healthier meals.
The second of these plate waste studies was conducted in 2015 and looked at the effectiveness of interventions such as our Chefs in Schools program. Students in schools with CIS had a 72% likelihood to select fruits as part of their school lunch and 64% more likely to select a vegetable.This compares with only 51% for fruits and 34% for vegetables without the intervention.;;; While we are proud of the work we are doing at Project Bread,our approach is simple and replicable: give school nutrition professionals the right support training,and recipes and they can make meals that are healthy,well sourced,and enjoyed by the students they serve.
Project Bread Response to USDA Proposed Rule
Based on our research and experience we have shared our concerns,feedback,and questions on the various proposals listed in the USDA proposed  rule.
We are sympathetic to the challenges of school nutrition  professionals and know that it takes effort, time, and ingenuity to change children's eating habits, but it can be done.
In June 2017,the USDA reported over 90 percent  of schools successfully met the updated nutrition standards,with reports of increased participation and revenue.This was affirmed in 2019 by USDA's School Nutrition and Meal Cost Study. Preserving the existing timeline for reductions  in sodium, requiring whole grains,and maintaining the requirement of non-fat  milk continues to motivate remaining schools to innovate.The USDA and organizations like Project Bread play a crucial role in helping school food authorities to succeed in providing the healthiest possible meals. The proposed  rule refers to the challenges of local operators;however rolling back these standard sends the wrong message. Nutrition professionals need and deserve more support. However they do not need flexibilities that come at the expense of our children.
This is not the time for rolling back the standards at the expense of these children. The flexibilities proposed by this rule could increase:
• Obesity:Intake of whole-grain products promotes satiety more quickly than refined grains due to their high fiber content. Eating refined grains may cause overconsumption of calories contributing to weight gain and obesity.
• Diabetes: Increased intake of refined grains means increased intake of simple sugars.which increase blood sugar and insulin resistance. resulting in increased risk tor diabetes.
 Heart Disease: High sodium intake is associated with high blood pressure in children and teenagers,with effects greater in those who are overweight or obese. In addition.1% flavored milk is higher in calories.cholesterol,and total fat than fat-free flavored milk.
Students Deserve High Quality, Nutritious, and Delicious School Meals
Students cannot learn on an empty stomach,but  they also cannot function at their best if they are not consuming a balanced,healthy diet. School meals are an opportunity to ensure children eat a healthy diet regardless of what they may eat at home. Whether that child is eating prepared healthy meals from scratch nightly or not eating at all in the evenings. they can rely on a nutritious school breakfast and lunch.
Any changes to school nutrition standards must reflect  dietary science and the goal to feed children the best possible meals at school. Unfortunately,many of the changes proposed  in this rule do not reflect  this goal. During this time of unprecedented food insecurity rates and health disparities,our nation's children need strong, evidence­ based nutrition standards that support their learning,health,and well-being. School meals should be consistent with the Dietary Guidelines for Americans,including serving whole-grains and limiting sodium and fat.
We are sympathetic to the challenges of school nutrition professionals and know that it takes effort, time. and ingenuity to feed children good food and change their eating habits,but it can be done. For the students' futures,it must be done.
We also urge the USDA to keep in mind that the value a school meal has in nourishing a student for one day is incredibly high,but  school meals as a whole are a learning opportunity. School meals are an opportunity to tangibly learn what foods are healthy and
what constitutes a healthy diet in a safe environment. In this way a school meal
transcends daily nourishments by establishing wholesome eating habits and building the foundation for healthy adults.

2020,FNS-2020-0038-2818,,Academic researchers,"To Whom It May Concern:
On behalf of the 67,000 primary care pediatricians, pediatric medical subspecialists, and surgical specialists of the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) who are committed to the attainment of optimal physical, mental, and social health and well-being for all infants, children, adolescents, and young adults, we appreciate this opportunity to provide comments on the Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) proposed rule regarding the National School Lunch and School Breakfast Program. Given the current COVID-19 pandemic as well as the expected release of the 2020-2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans, we strongly urge USDA to withdraw this proposed rule and instead focus efforts on ensuring all families receive adequate federal nutrition assistance, including those who have become newly eligible for programs due to a loss of family income and those who are uniquely vulnerable such as children in immigrant families, families with newborns, and those living in rural areas or those where transportation is a challenge.
The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has closed schools for in-person instruction throughout the country, led to record unemployment claims filed, and left families without adequate resources to feed their children. Now is not the time to impose bureaucratic barriers or confusion for schools as they deal with virtual learning, alternative food delivery models, and prepare to re-open their doors in the future. Because some children will have spent considerable time away from the usual school meals programs where they receive balanced, nutritious foods, once schools are able to resume normal operations, good nutrition will be more critical than ever. The proposed rule published by USDA does the opposite and is a step backwards. Under the guise of more flexibility, USDA’s proposed rule would weaken the nutritional quality of the school meals program.
Good nutrition is essential to health and good health is essential to effective learning. The National School Lunch program provides nutritionally balanced, low‐cost or free lunches to more than 30 million children each school day. Prior to the pandemic, roughly 14 million children received breakfast in their school. Given the double burden of food insecurity and obesity facing our children, it is essential that the meals children receive in school are nutritionally sound and based on the best available nutrition science. Children typically consume up to half of their daily calories in school, and for some children, the only food they eat each day comes from the federal school meals programs.
Today, almost one in three children lives in a household where food is scarce, and nearly one in three children and adolescents have overweight or obesity, we must redouble our efforts to replace unhealthy, nutrient-poor foods in schools with healthy, nutritious options. The importance of healthy school meals has taken on new urgency during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic which has left many more families unable to afford healthy, nutritious meals at home and even more reliant on federal nutrition programs such as the school meals program. Updated school lunch standards required under the 2010 Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act (HHFKA) and implemented in 2012 ensure that children have access to healthy school meals with more servings of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. According to USDA, the vast majority of schools currently comply with these standards, and our school food service personnel deserve tremendous credit for this success.i
AAP is disappointed that USDA’s proposed rule makes changes to the standards required under the HHFKA. Researchers estimate that the 2012 changes to the standards will prevent more than 2 million cases of childhood obesity and save up to $792 million in health-care related costs over ten years. Recent studies show that under the HHFKA standards, children’s eating habits are improving.ii Students of all ages are choosing lunches with higher nutritional quality and lower calories per gram and consuming more fruits and larger shares of their entrees and vegetables.iii USDA’s own research shows that plate waste has not increased with implementation of the HHFKA standards.iv Parents and teachers are also experiencing healthier eating habits because of the higher nutrition standards for foods sold in schools. The proposed changes in this rule could jeopardize this progress.
This proposed rule is the Administration’s second attempt to weaken nutrition in schools this year. Earlier this year, USDA issued a proposed rule that, if finalized, would lead to children eating less fruit at breakfast, fewer varieties of vegetables, and less healthy lunch options. We are disheartened that the agency is proposing to make even further changes to school meal standards that would weaken the nutritional quality of the school meals program. Continually weakening the standards does not provide more stability and consistency for schools or industry. On the contrary, it continuously changes the goalposts for school efforts and industry reformulation.
In addition to being released as the country deals with the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, this rule is untimely given the imminent release of the 2020-2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans (DGA). As the proposed rule notes, federal law requires that school meals be consistent with the goals of the latest DGA. Given that the 2020-2025 DGA are expected to be released this month at the conclusion of a two-year scientific process carried out by HHS and USDA, this proposed rule is premature. Because this rule was released before the DGA, we are unable to determine if the proposed changes to the sodium, whole grains, and milk standards are consistent with the latest dietary recommendations of the DGA, however, the changes proposed in this rule are inconsistent with the existing 2015-2020 DGA. As children’s diets now rarely align with the recommendations from the DGA, it is especially important for any new nutritional standards for school meals to closely mirror the guidance in the latest DGA.
Children deserve the best possible chance at success, and this means having access to healthy meals while they are in and outside the classroom. It may take offering healthy foods two, three, or even four times, it may take adults modeling good habits for children, and it may take creativity from food service providers. Implementation challenges schools face should be addressed through additional technical assistance, such as: time of day and length of time to eat; involving students in taste tests and meal planning; renaming and presenting the food in kid-friendly and appealing ways; providing adequate kitchen equipment; improving nutrition education; and scheduling recess before lunch. That is a commitment we can and should take on: to continue offering nutritious school meals for children. Anything less would jeopardize the tremendous progress made to date and would be a step back for child nutrition.
Thank you for the opportunity to provide these comments. Please don’t hesitate to contact Tamar Magarik Haro in AAP’s Washington Office at 202-347-8600 or tharo@aap.org should you have any questions. We look forward to working with you to ensure children have access to nutritious meals throughout the school day.

Thank you for the opportunity to comment on the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) proposed rule entitled, “Restoration of Milk, Whole Grains, and Sodium Flexibilities” (85 FR 75241). The proposed rule would reinstitute the changes to the School Breakfast Program (SBP) and National School Lunch Program (NSLP) sodium, whole grains, and flavored milk requirements (83 FR 63775, December 12, 2018). Those changes were widely opposed by the public1 and invalidated by a federal court over a lack of notice on key provisions.2 We urge that this proposed rule be withdrawn in its entirety.
The National Disability Rights Network (NDRN) is the non-profit membership association of Protection and Advocacy (P&A) agencies that are located in all 50 States, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the United States Territories. In addition, there is a P&A affiliated with the Native American Consortium which includes the Hopi, Navajo and San Juan Southern Paiute Nations in the Four Corners region of the Southwest. P&A agencies are authorized under various federal statutes to provide legal representation and related advocacy services, and to investigate abuse and neglect of individuals with disabilities in a variety of settings. The P&A Network comprises the nation’s largest provider of legally-based advocacy services for persons with disabilities, including advocacy on education and nutrition assistance.
The importance of healthy school meals has taken on new urgency during the ongoing coronavirus outbreak. Given the severe economic impacts of COVID-19, more children will likely continue to qualify for free or reduced-priced school meals. For many of these children, school breakfast and lunch may be the only nutritious meals they will consume in a day. The percentage of people experiencing food insecurity since the pandemic began has doubled overall and tripled among households with children.3 Additionally, access to nutritious breakfasts and lunches during school helps combat childhood hunger4 and improve academic achievement and test scores while reducing absenteeism, tardiness and discipline referrals5. These rollbacks fail to put children’s health and educational achievement first.
Thanks to the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010 (HHFKA), school meal, snack, and beverage standards were updated, access to free school meals was expanded, along with numerous other important provisions. The HHFKA is widely considered a significant public health success. Schools have made extraordinary progress toward serving healthier meals with less sodium, more whole grains, fruits, and vegetables, and removing soda, other sugary drinks, and unhealthy snack foods. Weakening these standards runs contrary to USDA’s 2019 School Nutrition and Meal Cost Study (SNMCS). This study is the first nationally-representative study to assess school meals after HHFKA and found that the nutritional quality of school lunches and breakfasts, measured by the Healthy Eating Index (HEI-2010) scores,6 increased by 41 percent and 44 percent, respectively, between school years 2009-10 and 2014-15.7 The study also found that schools made significant progress on whole grains8 and sodium reduction9; a majority of schools met daily meal components, especially for fruits and vegetables10; schools with healthier meals experienced higher participation rates in the program11; and plate waste remained the same.12
Weakening the standards will increase disparities in healthy food access. Prior to HHFKA, students in more affluent and large schools were more likely to have access to healthier foods than those in under resourced and small schools in states with weaker standards than states with stronger standards.13 The SNMCS found that the nutritional quality of school meals empowered by HHFKA is the same across socioeconomic status and race and ethnicity.14 Further, few states have policies on meal standards such as whole grains and flavored milk that would protect children from these rollbacks.15
The 2012 updates to school nutrition standards reflect sound science, support children’s health, and were developed in alignment with the 2010-2015 Dietary Guidelines for Americans (DGA)16 and the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM, formerly Institute of Medicine) 2009 report School Meals: Building Blocks for Healthy Children.17 Weakening these standards is a further departure from aligning school meals with the DGA and is not supported by the science or expert dietary advice.
Although Executive Orders 12866 and 13563 require agencies to assess costs and benefits of regulatory actions and select approaches that maximize net benefits, including the effect on public health and equity, USDA did not do these assessments for this proposed rule, nor did they consult the public health or medical communities. Further, USDA has not released the Civil Rights Impact Analysis for this proposed rule.
We oppose the proposed seven-year delay (from School Year 2017-2018 to School Year 2024-2025) of the second sodium reduction targets (Target 2) and elimination of the third sodium-reduction targets (Target 3). USDA noted in the 2018 interim final rule (IFR) that first rolled back these standards that they intended to re-evaluate the sodium reduction targets with the release of the 2020-2025 DGA.18 Similarly in this proposed rule, USDA notes that the law, “requires that school meals are consistent with the goals of the latest Dietary Guidelines for Americans (Dietary Guidelines).” Therefore, the Department should wait until after the 2020-2025 DGA are issued given its imminent release. 19 Further, many schools, food service companies, and others in industry have already made healthy and appealing meals and products with less sodium and rolling back these standards will reduce demand for lower-sodium products, making it harder for schools that want to offer lower-sodium products to do so.
We oppose weakening the whole grain standard from 100 percent of grains served being whole grain-rich to only 50 percent. This change is inconsistent with the DGA and does not support children’s health. USDA’s 2018 IFR showed that the vast majority of schools (85 percent) were meeting the 100 percent whole grain-rich standard.20 Similarly to rolling back sodium standards, rolling back the whole-grain-rich standard will make it harder for schools that want to continue to offer 100 percent whole-grain-rich to do so. Anecdotally, several school food service directors have stated that the whole-grain-rich products they were successfully offering are no longer available, and as a result they have been forced to switch to a non-whole-grain-rich option.
We oppose allowing flavored low-fat (1 percent) milk for school meals and as a competitive food. The current standards that allow plain or flavored fat-free milk and plain low-fat milk are based on expert recommendations from the NASEM’s 2009 report.21 Those recommendations disallowed flavored low-fat milk because it would provide more calories and likely exceed the calorie maximum for school meals. The 2015 DGA similarly recommended, “increasing the proportion of dairy intake that is fat-free or low-fat milk” and “reducing the intake of added sugars” such as those in flavored milk.22 Similarly, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation’s Healthier Beverage Guidelines recommend only plain fat-free and low-fat milk for children and adolescents.23 While the calorie ranges for age groups and grade were intended to limit meals with excessive amounts of added sugar, flavored skim milk is the most sugary item in breakfast and lunch24 and flavored low-fat milk will likely exacerbate this trend.
In addition, this proposed rule is part of a larger effort to roll back the nutrition standards and weaken the program. We are also concerned about the timing of this proposed rule and shortest possible 30-day comment period is problematic. As mentioned earlier, this proposed rule is premature, given the imminent release of the 2020-2025 DGA.25 Because this rule was released before the DGAs, the public and other stakeholders are not able to determine if the proposed changes to the sodium, whole grains, and milk standards are consistent with the latest dietary recommendations. The 30-day comment period may also make it difficult for stakeholders to comment. Many schools and impacted organizations are dealing with COVID-related feeding issues and are not able to devote adequate time to preparing comments. Executive Order 12866 advises that agencies should generally provide, at a minimum, at least 60 days for public comment.26
These rollbacks are counter to sound science, will harm children’s health, increase disparities, and dissuade industry innovation. Instead of weakening nutrition standards, we urge the administration to provide the technical assistance needed to support schools struggling with meeting the existing standards, and reconsider science-based standards that are consistent with the most recent DGA.

2020,FNS-2020-0038-2865,,Academic researchers,"I am a Licensed and Registered Dietitian with a Master&#39;s degree in Public Health Nutrition. I have worked with USDA Child Nutrition Programs for seven years. I&#39;m writing to oppose the flexibility to reduce the whole grain-rich requirement in NSLP and SBP to half the weekly grains. According to the 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans, ""intakes do not meet the recommendations for whole grains and exceed limits for refined grains. Average intakes of whole grains are far below recommended levels across all age-sex groups, and average intakes of refined grains are well above recommended limits for most age-sex groups."" The whole grain-rich (WGR) criteria already allows for grain products to contains only 50 percent whole grains and the remaining grain content of the product must be enriched. If we only strive for 50% WGR in NSLP and SBP, that could result in a minimum of 25% whole grains offered per week. This is not in line with the Dietary Guidelines recommendation of making at least half of your grains whole grains.<br/><br/>The USDA Child Nutrition Programs are public health programs, and as such, they should be set up to provide only the healthiest choices. We know from public health and behavioral economics that making the healthy choice the easy choice (or default choice) is a successful way to help people make healthy choices. If we make the default choice of NSLP and SBP meals less healthy, it will be even harder for students to make those healthy choices and build lifelong healthy habits and preferences. Successful public health efforts have also taught us that big changes take time. It can take many years for an entire population to shift behaviors and norms for the better, and we haven&#39;t given this change enough time to see it through. We shouldn&#39;t give up on it too early. Backing down on the whole grain-rich rules now will only set us back on our national public health nutrition goals.

We are the State agency in Vermont responsible for the National School Lunch Program (NSLP), School Breakfast Program (SBP), Summer Food Service Program (SFSP), the Child and Adult Care Food Program (CACFP), and USDA Foods Distribution. <br/><br/>First, we would like to raise concerns regarding the timing of the comment period for the proposed rule. These proposed changes to the meal pattern have long been controversial, as evidenced by the 86,247 comments received by FNS on the 2017 Interim Final Rule and multiple related legal challenges. Therefore, we find it very concerning that FNS issued this proposed rule the day before Thanksgiving, with comments due on the first working day after Christmas. This timing right in the middle of the holiday season likely suppresses the public&#39;s ability to hear about and respond to the proposed rule. In addition, the added challenges faced by program operators, families, and state agencies as a result of the COVID-19 global pandemic mean that many impacted parties are unlikely to have the bandwidth to read the rule and submit comments. We urge FNS to consider extending the comment period for a further 30 days. <br/><br/>Second, we would like to address the proposed changes to the whole grain rich requirement.  We do not support the changes to this requirement proposed by FNS. In 2019, when USDA relaxed the whole grain-rich requirement nationally, the Vermont State agency chose not to implement these flexibilities in Vermont for the NSLP and SBP. At the time we wrote: <br/><br/>""In 2012, USDA implemented new requirements for the nutritional value of foods served through the National School Lunch Program (NSLP) and School Breakfast Program (SBP). One of the changes to the ""Meal Pattern"" was a requirement that all grain items offered in the NSLP and SBP be whole grain-rich. This means that the grain item contains at least 50 percent whole grains, and the remaining grain content comes from enriched flour. The requirement was phased-in. In the first years of implementation, only  of the grain items served had to be whole grain-rich. Starting in 2014-2015, all grains were required to be whole grain-rich. <br/><br/>Implementation of the whole grain-rich requirement was initially challenging. Students were used to white flour products, and the food industry had not yet innovated to supply a wide variety of high-quality items that met the requirements. Items like whole grain-rich pasta required new preparation methods, which took additional training. However, these requirements have now been in effect for five years, and in Vermont we see very high rates of compliance. Food service managers have developed the recipes and skills to meet the new requirements. The food industry has developed a wide variety of quality whole grain-rich products. Local Vermont companies have been especially innovative and numerous Vermont bakeries produce bread, bagel and pizza items that meet the requirements. The Vermont New School Cuisine Cookbook includes kid-tested foodservice recipes for whole grain-rich biscuits, muffins, pancakes, pizza-dough, corn bread and many whole grain-based salads. In addition to publishing the cookbook, Vermont Child Nutrition Programs has provided numerous trainings on cooking with whole grains at our annual Summer Institute trainings and our annual TriState conference. Students are now familiar with the whole grain-rich products and we see high rates of student acceptance with the new products. For students in grades PreK-4, whole grain rich products are the only grain items they&#39;ve ever seen on their trays. Over the period since the new meal pattern went into effect, the overall number of lunches served in Vermont has decreased slightly, but the overall number of breakfasts has increased. During this same time period student population was declining, and we have not analyzed the data to see if the decline in enrollment accounts for some or all of the decline in number of lunches served.""<br/><br/>Vermont has continued to maintain this requirement in the years since, meaning children and industry have had even more time to adjust.  <br/><br/>Comment Continued in attached letter<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/><br/>Mary Rose Krueger<br/>State Director of Child Nutrition Programs<br/>Vermont Agency of Education <br/><br/>",In favor of original HHFKA

Our members represent many thousands of people nationwide.  We urge you to withdraw the rule to continue the rollback of healthy nutrition standards for school meals. This rule will make permanent weaker nutrition standards for whole grains, sodium, and milk.<br/> <br/>We are particularly concerned that you would once again attempt to overturn sound nutritional standards during this period of alarming increases in food scarcity.  The most recent findings from the U.S. Census Bureau&#39;s Household Pulse Survey (covering the period of November 25-December 7) show extremely high proportions of adults living with children reporting that their households ""sometimes or often did not have enough to eat"" in the preceding 7 days.  That was true of 17.5 percent of all adults living with children (14.3 million people).  Because communities of color are disproportionately poor and have been disproportionately affected by COVID-19, about one in four Hispanic and Black people in households with children did not have enough to eat in the previous week.  Nearly one in four (23.6 percent) in households where children get free school meals said they sometimes or often did not have enough to eat.  <br/><br/>We emphasize this point because inability to afford enough food makes it all the more important that school meals are as nutritious as possible.  It is well known that families struggling with poverty are forced to rely on foods with more empty calories and sodium.  School meals should protect children&#39;s health by offering something better.  <br/><br/>There is considerable research showing how important adequate nutrition is for children&#39;s healthy development and school performance.  At a time when it is especially difficult for children in families with low incomes to manage school, children should not have to face the additional difficulty of inadequate nutrition. School meals should be consistent with the Dietary Guidelines for Americans, including serving whole-grains and limiting sodium and fat.<br/><br/>Please withdraw this proposed rule and in addition extend the comment period to 60 days, so more people have the opportunity to comment.  When comments were sought when USDA first tried to impose this rollback of standards, over 90 percent of those commenting opposed such a move.

2020,FNS-2020-0038-2915,,Advocacy,"Healthy School Food Maryland (HSFM) respectfully submits comments in response
to the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) proposed rule entitled: “Restoration
of Milk, Whole Grains, and Sodium Flexibilities” (85 FR 75241). HSFM is a parent and
student advocacy group committed to helping the Montgomery County Public
Schools make equitable improvements to school food policy; to help build the
capacity of families to be active in school communities; and to increase transparency
about the food environment in schools. The proposal would reinstitute the school
nutrition changes on sodium, whole grains, and flavored milk (83 FR 63775,
December 12, 2018). We successfully opposed those changes in federal court over a
lack of notice on key provisions and are alarmed to see the proposed restoration of
these same changes. These rollbacks fail to put children’s health first, which is the
clear goal of school nutrition programs under statute.
The importance of healthy school meals has taken on new urgency during the
ongoing coronavirus outbreak. Given the severe economic impacts of COVID-19,
more children will continue to qualify for free or reduced-priced school meals. For
many of these children, school breakfast and lunch may be the only nutritious meals
they will consume in a day.
The Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010 (HHFKA) updated school meal, snacks,
and beverage standards and expanded access to free school meals, among numerous
other important provisions, and is widely considered a significant public-health
success. Schools have made extraordinary progress toward serving healthier meals
with less sodium; more whole grains, fruits, and vegetables; and no trans fat, and
removing soda, other sugary drinks, and unhealthy snack foods.
Weakening the standards will create winners and losers for children’s access to
healthier foods. Stronger nutrition standards help reduce disparities in healthy food
access. The 2012 updates to school nutrition standards reflect sound science,
support children’s health, and are consistent with the 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans (DGA)1 and the National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM, formerly
Institute of Medicine) 2009 report School Meals: Building Blocks for Healthy Children.2 Weakening these
standards is a further departure from aligning school meals with the DGA and is not supported by the science or
expert dietary advice.
We oppose the proposed seven-year delay (from School Year 2017-2018 to School Year 2024-2025) of the
second sodium-reduction targets (Target 2) and elimination of the third sodium-reduction targets (Target 3).
USDA noted in the 2018 interim final rule (IFR) that first rolled back these standards that they intended to reevaluate
the sodium-reduction targets with the release of the 2020-2025 DGA.3 Similarly in this proposed rule,
USDA notes that the law, “requires that school meals are consistent with the goals of the latest Dietary Guidelines
for Americans (Dietary Guidelines) (emphasis added).” NASEM updated the Dietary Reference Intake (DRI) for
sodium in 20194 which will be the basis for sodium recommendations in the upcoming 2020-2025 DGA.5 That
report established a Chronic Disease Risk Reduction (CDRR) level for sodium in recognition that exceeding these
levels would increase chronic disease risk within a healthy population. NASEM made even stronger sodium
recommendations for younger school-aged children than was the case when the 2012 school meal standards
were finalized: from 2,200 mg to 1,800 mg for children aged 9-13 and from 1,900 mg to 1,500 mg for children
aged 4-8.6 Therefore, the Department should wait until after the 2020-2025 DGA are issued given its imminent
release. 7 The stakes for children’s health could not be higher: nine out of ten children consume too much
sodium,8 increasing their risk of high blood pressure, heart disease, and stroke.9 Further, many schools, food
service companies, and others in industry made healthy and appealing meals and products with less sodium and
rolling back these standards will make it harder for schools to procure lower-sodium products.
We oppose weakening the whole-grain-rich standard from 100 to 50 percent. This is inconsistent with the DGA
and does not support children’s health. Eating more whole grains is associated with reduced risk of heart disease,
stroke, and diabetes, provides more nutrients, and are a healthful source of fiber.10 Children, on average,
consume too few whole grains and too many refined grains.11 USDA’s 2018 IFR showed that the vast majority of
schools (85 percent) were meeting the 100-percent whole-grain-rich standard.12
We oppose allowing flavored low-fat (1 percent) milk for school meals and as a competitive food. The current
standards that allow plain or flavored fat-free milk and plain low-fat milk are based on expert recommendations
from the National Academy of Medicine’s 2009 report.13 Those recommendations disallowed flavored low-fat milk
because it would provide more calories and likely exceed the calorie maximum for school meals. The 2015 DGA
similarly recommended, “increasing the proportion of dairy intake that is fat-free or low-fat milk” and “reducing
the intake of added sugars” such as those in flavored milk.14 Similarly, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation’s
Healthier Beverage Guidelines recommend only plain fat-free and low-fat milk for children and adolescents.15
Weakening the standards makes it more difficult for schools that want to do what is right for their students. For
instance, requiring sodium-reduction targets or 100-percent whole-grain-rich incentivizes companies to
reformulate and make products that meet these standards, without which these products would not be
competitively priced, widely available, and appealing to kids. Many schools that want to meet 100-percent wholegrain-
rich have now had difficulty procuring certain products because companies are no longer producing the
whole-grain-rich equivalent of the product. Similarly, schools that want to achieve Target 3 would have to procure
products that are currently less available and therefore pricier.
HSFM sees this proposed rule as part of a larger effort to roll back the nutrition standards and weaken the
program. Earlier this year, USDA proposed enlarging the junk food loophole that would allow schools to serve
more entrée items as competitive foods without meeting the Smart Snacks standards, reduce the variety of
vegetables, and reduce the amount of fruit in breakfast in the classroom, among other problematic changes.16
We oppose delay of the second and elimination of the third sodium-reduction targets, weakening the wholegrain-
rich standard from 100 to 50 percent, and allowing flavored low-fat milk. We urge the administration to
reconsider science-based standards that are consistent with the most recent DGA.

Normally, nearly thirty million children eat school lunch daily; about 74 percent of these children live in low-income households.1 Nearly fifteen million students eat school breakfast daily, and about 80 percent of these students are categorized as low-income.2  <br/>Most American children do not consume sufficient amounts of whole grains and fiber and consume too much sodium and fat, thus putting them at long-term risk for developing chronic conditions such as hypertension and heart disease.3,4 <br/>School meals should be consistent with the Dietary Guidelines for Americans, including serving whole-grains and limiting sodium and fat. Research shows that children consume as much as half of their daily calories at school and food served by schools have a significant impact on students&#39; nutrition, dietary quality, physical and mental health, academic performance and academic achievement.5,6, 7<br/><br/>FRAC strongly opposes the USDA&#39;s decision to retain Sodium Target 1 through SY 2023-2024, delay Target 2 until SY 2024-SY 2025 and eliminate the third and final sodium reduction target. While FRAC recognizes that schools will experience challenges with achieving the sodium standards for multiple reasons, it is important that a reasonable, practical timeline be created to implement sodium standards consistent with the Dietary Guidelines for Americans.  The timeline should allow schools to plan, source, and test meals that are nutritious, palatable to students and abide by new guidelines. The Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act requires schools serve meals ""consistent with the goals of the most recent"" dietary guidelines and the 2020-2025 Dietary Guidelines will soon be released. Given that 90 percent of children eat more sodium than recommended and increased sodium intake is associated with long-term increased risk of hypertension, heart attack and stroke, it is imperative that robust sodium restrictions on school meals be maintained to prevent future chronic illness. 8,9<br/><br/>FRAC also opposes the USDA&#39;s decision to weaken the whole grains standard. In addition to being a rich source of fiber and other essential nutrients, whole grains can help improve blood cholesterol levels and are associated with reduced risk of heart disease, stroke, obesity and diabetes.10 Changing this standard may compromise children&#39;s health by reducing the amount of whole grain-rich food available to students at school. Like the delay to further lower sodium levels, the weakening of the whole grain requirement does not meet original standards, which were vital to improving the dietary intake and health of students.11 Several studies, including a 2016 analysis conducted by FRAC, have demonstrated that the revised nutrition standards have had a positive impact on the school nutrition environment as well as on school food selection and consumption. Since the USDA has reported that a majority of schools have not requested waivers and are able to provide students with appealing whole grain options, FRAC urges the USDA to continue to provide exemptions as well as technical assistance and support to schools that are unable to meet whole grain requirements.12 <br/>It is especially crucial that strong nutrition standards are enforced to achieve equity for low-income communities and communities of color. Black and Hispanic/Latinx households have consistently reported higher rates of food insecurity and hunger when compared to other groups, and children of color are disproportionately impacted by diet-related chronic conditions such as obesity and diabetes.13,14 Choosing to weaken nutrition standards for school meals not only perpetuates these health disparities, it also perpetuates disparities in educational attainment and academic performance that exist among these populations.

Schools have made extraordinary progress toward serving healthier meals with less sodium, more whole grains, fruits, and vegetables, and removing soda, other sugary drinks, and unhealthy snack foods. Research shows that the 2012 and 2014 nutrition standards could prevent up to two million cases of childhood obesity and save up to $792 million in healthcare costs over ten years.7 Another study found that for children in poverty, the risk of obesity declined substantially each year after implementation of HHFKA such that obesity prevalence would have been 47 percent higher in 2018 if the nutrition standards had not been updated.$
Weakening these standards runs contrary to USDA's 2019 School Nutrition and Meal Cost Study (SNMCS). This study is the first nationally-representative study to assess school meals after HHFKA and found that the nutritional quality of school lunches and breakfasts, measured by the Healthy Eating Index (HEI-2010) scores,9 increased by 41 percent and 44 percent, respectively, between school years 2009-10 and 2014-15.10 The study also found that schools made significant progress on whole grains"" and sodium reduction 12; a majority of schools met daily meal components, especially for fruits and vegetables 13 ; schools with healthier meals experienced higher participation rates in the program 14; and plate waste remained the same. 15
Weakening the standards will increase disparities in healthy food access. Prior to HHFKA, students in more affluent and large schools were more likely to have access to healthier foods than those in under resourced and small schools in states with weaker standards than states with stronger standards. 16 The SNMCS found that the nutritional quality of school meals empowered by HHFKA is the same across socioeconomic status and race and ethnicity.17 Further, few states have policies on meal standards such as whole grains and flavored milk that would protect children from these rollbacks. 18
The 2012 updates to school nutrition standards reflect sound science, support children's health, and were developed in alignment with the 2010-2015 Dietary Guidelines for Americans (DGA)19 and the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM, formerly Institute of Medicine) 2009 report School Meals: Building Blocks for Healthy Children. 20 Weakening these standards is a further departure from aligning school meals with the DGA and is not supported by the science or expert dietary advice.
Although Executive Orders 12866 and 13563 require agencies to assess costs and benefits of regulatory actions and select approaches that maximize net benefits, including the effect on public health and equity, USDA did not do these assessments for this proposed rule, nor did they consult the public health or medical communities. Further, USDA has not released the Civil Rights Impact Analysis for this proposed rule.
We oppose the proposed seven-year delay (from School Year 2017-2018 to School Year 2024-2025) of the second sodium reduction targets (Target 2) and elimination of the third sodium-reduction targets (Target 3). USDA noted in the 2018 interim final rule (IFR) that first rolled back these standards that they intended to re-evaluate the sodium reduction targets with the release of the 2020-2025 DGA.21 Similarly in this proposed rule, USDA notes that the law, ""requires that school meals are consistent with the goals of the latest Dietary Guidelines for Americans (Dietary Guidelines) (emphasis added)."" NASEM updated the Dietary Reference Intake (DRI) for sodium in 201922 which will be the basis for sodium recommendations in the upcoming 2020-2025 DGA.23 That report established a Chronic Disease Risk Reduction (CDRR) level for sodium in recognition that exceeding these levels would increase chronic disease risk within a healthy population. NASEM made even stronger sodium recommendations for younger school-aged children than was the case when the 2012 school meal standards were finalized: lowering the limit for sodium from 2,200 mg to 1,800 mg for children aged 9-13 and from 1,900 mg to 1,500 mg for children aged 4-8.24 Therefore, the Department should wait until after the 2020-2025 DGA are issued given its imminent release. 25 The stakes for children's health could not be higher: nine out of ten children consume too much sodium '26 increasing their risk of high blood pressure, heart disease, and stroke .2' Further, many schools, food service companies, and others in industry have already made healthy and appealing meals and products with less sodium and rolling back these standards will reduce demand for lower-sodium products, making it harder for schools that want to offer lower-sodium products to do so.
We oppose weakening the whole grain standard from 100 percent of grains served being whole grain-rich to only 50 percent. This change is inconsistent with the DGA and does not support children's health. Eating more whole grains is associated with reduced risk of heart disease, stroke, and diabetes. Whole grains also provide more nutrients and are a healthful source of fiber. 28 Children, on average, consume too few whole grains and too many refined grains .29 USDA's 2018 IFR showed that the vast majority of schools (85 percent) were meeting the 100 percent whole grain-rich standard.30 Similarly to rolling back sodium standards, rolling back the whole-grain-rich standard will make it harder for schools that want to continue to offer 100 percent whole-grain-rich to do so. Anecdotally, several school foodservice directors have stated that the whole-grain-rich products they were successfully offering are no longer available, and as a result they have been forced to switch to a non-whole-grain-rich option.
We oppose allowing flavored low-fat (1 percent) milk for school meals and as a competitive food. The current standards that allow plain or flavored fat-free milk and plain low-fat milk are based on expert recommendations from the NASEM's 2009 report.31 Those recommendations disallowed flavored low-fat milk because it would provide more calories and likely exceed the calorie maximum for school meals. The 2015 DGA similarly recommended, ""increasing the proportion of dairy intake that is fat-free or low-fat milk"" and ""reducing the intake of added sugars"" such as those in flavored milk.32 Similarly, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation's Healthier Beverage Guidelines recommend only plain fat-free and low-fat milk for children and adolescents. 33 While the calorie ranges for age groups and grade were intended to limit meals with excessive amounts of added sugar, flavored skim milk is the most sugary item in breakfast and lunch34 and flavored low-fat milk will likely exacerbate this trend.
In addition, this proposed rule is part of a larger effort to roll back the nutrition standards and weaken the program. Earlier this year, USDA proposed widening the junk food loophole that would allow schools to serve more entr6e items as competitive foods without meeting the Smart Snacks standards, reduce the variety of vegetables, and reduce the amount of fruit in breakfast in the classroom, among other problematic changes. 35 If those proposed rollbacks go into effect, research estimates the junk food loophole would add approximately 662 mg of sodium and 3 g of saturated fat over three days (or 1103 mg sodium and 5 g saturated fat over a week) on average relative to Smart Snacks limits currently in place. 36 Further, a Health Impact Assessment found the additional proposed changes would adversely affect students' health and academic performance, and that students from low-income families attending schools that are majority Black or Hispanic and in rural neighborhoods are most likely to be impacted by the proposed changes (while this study focused on the 2020 proposed rollbacks, it can also be generally applied to the rollbacks in this proposed rule).37 
We are also concerned about the timing of this proposed rule and shortest possible 30-day comment period is problematic. As mentioned earlier, this proposed rule is premature, given the imminent release of the 2020-2025 DGA.38 Because this rule was released before the DGAs, the public and other stakeholders are not able to determine if the proposed changes to the sodium, whole grains, and milk standards are consistent with the latest dietary recommendations. The 30-day comment period may also make it difficult for stakeholders to comment. Many schools and impacted organizations are dealing with COVID-related feeding issues and are not able to devote adequate time to preparing comments. Executive Order 12866 advises that agencies should generally provide, at a minimum, at least 60 days for public comment.39
Additional detailed comments follow:
The delay of Target 2 and elimination of Target 3 would harm children's health
Unfortunately, children on average consume between 2,500 to 4,200 mg of sodium per day, well over the recommended levels. 40 Excess sodium consumption is strongly associated with the development and worsening of high blood pressure and an increased risk of coronary heart disease, stroke, heart failure, kidney failure, gastric cancer, and osteoporosis.41 A substantial number of studies show that as dietary sodium intake rises, so does blood pressure.42 Studies show a link between high blood pressure in childhood and high blood pressure in adulthood, and high blood pressure in childhood is linked to early development of heart disease and risk for premature death.43
Of concern, the prevalence of high blood pressure is increasing in American children.44 Already about one in six children aged 8-17 have raised blood pressure.45 Children are at higher risk of developing heart disease and elevated blood pressure at earlier ages if they are obese or eat too much sodium .46 Children who eat higher-sodium diets are about 40 percent more likely to have elevated blood pressure than children who eat lower-sodium diets.47
The good news is that lowering sodium consumption can have a tremendous impact on public health. Studies show that reduced sodium intake can lower blood pressure, control hypertension, and prevent cardiovascular disease. 41,41 In addition, lowering sodium consumption, and thereby lowering blood pressure, can reduce medical costs. From 2012 to 2013, high blood pressure cost the United States an estimated $51.2 billion in direct and indirect costs. 50
Along with the DGA, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the World Health Organization, the American Heart Association, and other experts all recommend limiting sodium intake to less than 2,300 mg.51 The CDRR level for sodium in children aged 4-8 years and 9-13 years is even lower, at 1,900 mg and 2,200 mg, respectively.52 At the current levels (Target 1), a high school lunch has on average 1,420 mg, or about two-thirds a day's worth.
In anticipation of schools being required to meet the original sodium-reduction targets, companies have worked hard to reformulate their products. For example, school food company Revolution Foods already provides school meals that meet the Target 3 sodium levels. Schwan's Company—the largest producer of school pizza—produces the pizza for Revolution Foods and has already invested in the technology and resources to make appealing school pizzas that meet Targets 2 and 3. In addition, many companies—including Aramark,53 ConAgra Foods,54 Domino's Pizza (Smart Slice),55 General Mi11s,56 Kellogg's,57 Kraft Foods,58 Mars,59 Nestl6'61 PepsiCo, 61 and Unilever 62--areengaged in voluntary sodium reduction across their full lines of consumer products, which should aid school sodium reduction efforts. And we expect industry efforts will soon intensify as the Food and Drug Administration is preparing to release voluntary sodium reduction targets for processed, packaged, and restaurant foods. This also complements state and local efforts such as New York City's National Salt and Sugar Reduction Initiative 63and CDC's Sodium Reduction in Communities Program. 64 A variety of methods and technologies are available to help reduce levels of sodium in many food categories. 65
While we are not aware of USDA collecting data on implementation beyond Target 1, we know that prior to the pandemic, many schools had been working hard and are at or very close to meeting Target 2 levels. For example, the school meals program in Elbert County Schools, Georgia has done tremendous work to get their menus down to safe levels of sodium. They have employed tactics such as training staff to analyze sodium content in their menus; educating students on nutrition and menu changes; working with local and regional companies to find alternative products that met their sodium needs; and re-working their recipes to keep their foods with less sodium appealing to students. 66 Other schools have also lowered sodium by using spice bars and salad bars that gives students more options to provide flavor with less salt. Schools all around the country—from Virginia to California, Indiana to Kansas, Oklahoma to New York, and Georgia to North Dakota—have successfully used these best practices to meet the Target 1 and Target 2 sodium levels. USDA should put greater effort into elevating and sharing these methods and encouraging their adoption by other schools around the country.
USDA programs like ""Team Up for School Nutrition Success"" and the ""What's Shaking?"" initiative have been beneficial, but USDA has not kept these programs active. Congress has recognized the need to provide dedicated technical assistance on sodium reduction for schools and included $1 million in the House FY202067 and FY202168 Agriculture Appropriations bills (the funding was not included in the FY2020 final spending bill and at the time of this writing FY2021 is still being negotiated). USDA needs to focus on targeted technical assistance that delivers more intensive and personalized training for those programs that may still have difficulties lowering sodium. In addition, the USDA Foods (commodities) program has set a good example for schools by providing more moderate-sodium options and that work should continue.
Weakening the whole grain-rich standard would harm children's health
The 2015 DGA recommends making at least half of all grains whole grain-69 Children aged 4 to 18 do not meet the recommended intake for whole grains and exceed the recommended limit for refined grains. 70 Eating more whole grains is associated with reduced risk of heart disease, stroke, and diabetes, provides more nutrients, and are a healthful source of fiber. 71 Prior to the 2018 rollbacks, whole grain-rich products were widely prevalent in the marketplace. In December 2017, the Alliance for a Healthier Generation's Smart Food Planner, an online database that featured food and beverage products that align with the school nutrition standards, showed that approximately 874 whole grain-rich products were currently available for purchase by schools (the Alliance no longer maintains this database).72 Further, USDA Foods provides more whole grain products and has developed a number of resources that list whole grain-rich options. 73
Many schools across the U.S. are offering whole grain-rich products on their menus that students enjoy. Successful strategies for encouraging students to eat more whole grains include student surveys, samples and taste tests, experimenting with new products and recipes, and peer-to-peer sharing of food preparation techniques. These techniques have also been successful in sodium reduction efforts.
USDA had noted in the 2018 IFR that 85 percent of schools had not requested waivers and are providing children with appealing whole grain options. Some states did not have any schools requesting waivers such as Alabama, Idaho, and Montana, and others did not allow waivers such as Arkansas, Maryland, and Rhode Island.74 Some states had multiple waivers for only one type of product (e.g., pasta) like South Dakota, while North Dakota does not. If the vast majority of schools can provide whole grain-rich options, the rest should be able to as well. We encourage USDA to instead provide additional training and technical assistance to school districts that currently are asking for waivers and are having difficulty meeting the whole grain-rich requirement.
Allowing flavored low fat (I Yo) milk is inconsistent with expert dietary advice and school needs
Allowing schools to serve flavored low-fat milk would be inconsistent with expert nutrition recommendations based on the National Academy of Medicine's 2009 report75 and the 2015 DGA.76 Similarly, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation's Healthier Beverage Guidelines recommend only plain fat-free and low-fat milk for children and adolescents. 77
According to USDA's report Special Nutrition Program Operations Study School Year 2013-2014, only 13 percent of school food authorities (SFAs) found the milk standards challenging overall—this rate was the second lowest reported for any food category. 78 For breakfast, the rate was even lower, at six percent the lowest reported among all challenges .79 When the new milk requirements went into effect, 75 percent of SFAs stated that they did not observe any change in the amount of milk wasted, suggesting that student acceptance was not a problem.80 Further, roughly one in five SFAs reported choosing milk as the item to offer students who requested more food on the lunch line, showing that it remains an appealing beverage option for students. 81 Finally, virtually all SFAS (more than 90 percent) have employed strategies to encourage milk consumption, such as displaying plain milk in all-milk coolers, having plain milk account for at least one-third of the drinks displayed in each cooler, and placing plain milk in front of or before flavored milk or other sugary beverages. 82 USDA should encourage these strategies and address any remaining challenges for the few SFAs through training and technical assistance.
Conclusion
We oppose delaying Sodium Target 2 and eliminating Sodium Target 3, weakening the whole grain-rich standard from 100 to 50 percent of all grains served, and allowing flavored low-fat milk. These rollbacks are counter to sound science, will harm children's health, increase disparities, and dissuade industry innovation. Instead of weakening nutrition standards, we urge the administration to provide the technical assistance needed to support schools struggling with meeting the existing standards, and reconsider science-based standards that are consistent with the most recent DGA.

2020,FNS-2020-0038-2933,,Advocacy,"To Ms. Namian:
On behalf of the Food Research & Action Center (FRAC), please accept these comments on the proposed rule, ""Restoration of Milk, Whole Grains, and Sodium Flexibilities"" 85 Fed. Reg. 75241(November 25, 2020).  We are disappointed with the Administration's decision to once again propose a rule that would continue the rollback of healthy nutrition standards for school meals. This last-ditch effort to
sustain existing rollbacks will make permanent weaker nutrition standards for whole
grains, sodium, and milk.
FRAC strongly opposes this proposal to secure nutrition standards roll backs, and instead supports the original, evidence-based healthy school meal standards. Research has shown the positive impact of the original healthy school meal nutrition standards on school food offerings, school meal disparities, and student nutrition­ related outcomes.
Our nation's children need strong, evidence-based nutrition standards that support their learning, health and well-being. Normally, nearly thirty million children eat school lunch daily; about 74 percent of these children live in low-income households.1Nearly fifteen million students eat school breakfast daily, and about 8o percent of these students are categorized as low-income.2
Most American children do not consume sufficientamounts of whole_grains and fiber and consume too much sodium and fat, thus putting them at long-term risk for developing chronic conditions such as hypertension and heart disease.3A
School meals should be consistent with the Dietary Guidelines for Americans, including serving whole-grains and limiting sodium and fat. Research shows that children consume as much as half of their daily calories at school and food served by schools have a significant impact on students' nutrition, dietary quality, physical and mental health, academic performance and academic achievement.s,6, 7
 
FRAC opposes USDA's decision to retain Sodium Target 1 through SY
2023-2024, delay Target 2 until SY 2024-SY 2025 and eliminate the third and final sodium reduction target.While FRAC recognizes that schools will experience challenges with achieving the sodium standards for multiple reasons, it is important that a reasonable, practical timeline be created to implement sodium standards consistent with the Dietary Guidelines for Americans. The timeline should allow schools to plan, source, and test meals that are nutritious, palatable to students and abide by new guidelines. The Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act requires schools serve meals ""consistent with the goals of the most recent"" dietary guidelines and the 2020-2025 Dietary Guidelines will soon be released. Given that
90 percent of  children eat more sodium than recommended and increased sodium intake is associated with long-term increased risk of hypertension, heart attack and
stroke, it is imperative that robust sodium restrictions on school meals be maintained to prevent future chronic illness. 8,9
FRAC opposes USDA's decision to weaken the whole grains standard. In addition to being a rich source of fiber and other essential nutrients, whole grains can help improve blood cholesterol levels and are associated with reduced risk of heart disease, stroke, obesity and diabetes.1 ° Changing this standard may compromise children's health by reducing the amount of whole grain-rich food available to students at school. Like the delay to further lower sodium levels, the weakening of the whole grain requirement does not meet original standards, which were vital to improving the dietary intake and health of students.11 Several studies, including a 2016 analysis conducted by FRAC, have demonstrated that the re·vised nutrition standards have had a positive impact on the school nutrition environment
as well as on school food selection and consumption. Since USDA has reported that a
majority of schools had not requested waivers and were able to provide students with appealing whole grain options, FRAC urges USDA to continue to provide exemptions as well as technical assistance and support to schools that are unable to meet whole grain requirements.12
It is especially crucial that strong nutrition standards are enforced to achieve equity for low-income communities and communities of color. Black and Hispanic/Latinx households have consistently reported higher rates of
food insecurity and hunger when compared to other groups, and children of color are disproportionately impacted by diet-related chronic conditions such as obesity and diabetes.l3,l4 Choosing to weaken nutrition standards fpr school meals not only perpetuates these health disparities, it also perpetuates disparities in educational attainment and academic performance that exist among these populations. A 2020
Robert Wood Johnson-funded Health Impact Assessment of earlier proposed changes to school nutrition standards highlighted the negative impact on the health and learning of students from low-income households, those attending school in predominantly Black or Hispanic neighborhoods and those in rural areas would be
 
most likely to be adversely impacted.lS Inequities in education can negatively influence children's future access to employment, stable housing, healthy food and safe recreational spaces as well as healthcare utilization, all factors which can influence future well-being.
In conclusion, FRAC opposes this proposed rule and recommends working out a practical timeline for implementing the original standards consistent with the Dietary Guidelines for Americans. In addition, USDA should extend the comment period to 6o days.
