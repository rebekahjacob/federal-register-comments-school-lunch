2017,FNS-2017-0021-1186,nan,School,"For us small school corporations, there are not people to manage all the nutritional requirements that larger schools have.  They have multiple directors, dieticians, etc. as well as software to run nutritionals.  In small schools it's all we can do to just get meals served, and try to follow the nutrition regulations.  
The whole grain exemption is great and should continue.  I try to do WG, but for some pasta I do white pasta (rotini, kluski noodles).  The student acceptance and appearance are greatly improved.  I am thinking of returning to white bread for grilled cheese sandwiches. So keeping the requirement with waiver is great!
Milk.  I am not changing from skim chocolate to 1% chocolate.  This is solely due to cost.  While a penny more for 1% seems little, over an entire school year it is thousands of dollars, not a couple hundred.  The milk vendors want to produce one or the other for schools.  Our current one wants to keep with skim chocolate and strawberry milks.  
Sodium.  Again, difficult to have time to monitor.  It's best to keep the level-target, 
where it is now.  Manufacturers have made products better, but everything being reformulated to hit a lower target, makes more reporting, printing, recordkeeping.

2. Many grains baked with the whole wheat requirement are bitter tasting and we are throwing away a lot of grains. Please continue the exemptions and do not impose the 100%whole grain rule.
3. The sodium levels must NEVER be lowered. Students constantly complain about food having no flavor. The number of trays served each year continues to decrease and the number of students bringing their lunch increases. Students who bring their lunches often have foods that are not as healthy as those served in the cafeteria but they don't care because at least their food has flavor. Please, please never decrease the sodium level and if possible, increase the allowed amount of sodium.
4. Please get rid of the requirement to serve vegetables from the different groups. Kids are getting very tired of the same veggies and we are throwing away a lot of vegetables.",In favor of flexibilies
2017,FNS-2017-0021-1191,nan,School,"I am pleased that the regulation has been altered to allow 1%low fat flavored milk to be offered to students. Offering skim milk flavored milk has drastically reduced the amount of milk our students drink. This is of concern since calcium is one of the nutrients children are routinely have a low intake.
Speaking of this, I do not agree with the decision that high school and middle school students are limited to 12 oz of milk. We are unable to purchase milk in 12 oz containers and one our best sellers were 16oz milk container. This is equivalent to 2 glasses of milk which is a significant amount of calcium for the student but the regulation does not allow this. The regulation does not stop a student from purchasing two separate cartons of milk...what is the difference. This is a regulation that needs eliminated. ",In favor of flexibilies
2017,FNS-2017-0021-1236,nan,School,"As a food service director the biggest challenge i have is planning menus with the restrictions on sodium and calories.
I know i can add more protein and grains but does not help with the calories so i am still limited.
I have gone to fresh vegetables trying to keep the sodium levels down plus it is healthier but when a fresh egg has 62 grams of sodium in it, it becomes an uphill battle of finding ways to get the sodium levels where they need to be.
The manufactures of our foods are doing there best at providing us with low sodium products but trying to keep up with the changes often times short us of our food. I can't image what it will be like if the target 2 and 3 goes into effect.
I also believe that some of the foods should go by regional areas. 
Western, Central, Eastern and Southern regions don't eat all the same and I think when menu planning begins for the meals that should be taken into account.
Please lift the restrictions so we can feed the students the foods they will like and remember so when they become older they will have memories to talk about what their favorite school lunch was and not what the food they refused to eat because of the restrictions.",In favor of flexibilies
2017,FNS-2017-0021-1271,nan,School,It would make it much easier to be able to make meals from scratch plus the kids would like the opportunity to have the choice of milk options in all our schools.,In favor of flexibilies
2017,FNS-2017-0021-1272,nan,School,"Milk- Our district has no difficulties obtaining skim flavored milk. The skim flavored sells 6-7 times more than plain skim and 1% combined. I believe it is important to allow flavored milk but rather skim or 1% does not matter to our district. 
Whole Grains- Allowing districts to serve non whole grain items is huge for the NSLP. If the goal of the program is to encourage healthy balanced eating- like the ""myplate model"" and the Dietary Guidelines for Americans- then the NSLP should have the same expectations. DGA state to consume half whole grains, thus NSLP should do the same. Kids do need more whole grains, and I do believe it is important for them to consume but some food items just are not as appealing or well accepted. Obviously, this changes by region, but I believe districts should have this option. We currently serve white rice and a few non-whole grain pasta dishes because it is just more appealing to the students. However, breading on items, pizza, buns, tortillas, chips, bread we use whole grain for and the kids don't seem to mind. Schools can offer and serve great and healthy food but if students aren't consuming that at home, it's hard to get them to consume it at school. That is why pasta and rice are not well accepted in our district. 
Sodium Target- Thank goodness the next target was delayed. We've changed products, reduced sauces, reduced condiments, don't cook with or serve salt... but we still are barley hitting the accepted sodium level. Food needs taste in order for kids to eat it. So the debate- salt and eat it or no salt and trash it leading to hunger and disrupted classrooms. Until kitchens can move back to scratch cooking, the sodium level isn't realistic. Obviously, cooking from scratch yields healthier food. I think most districts love the idea of moving back to scratch cooking. It provides more wholesome food, food cost is less, it provides opportunities for more full time employment, and allows for more menu flexibility. However, it's going to take a decade or more to move back that direction. We've been doing heat/serve operations for so long now, kitchens and staff are not equipped for scratch cooking. There's a lot of money and training that need to go into it before we'll see that change. And is this the change the public wants? They are our customers right. As a parent, I'd rather a home cooked meal for my child but that doesn't always mean food they'll consume. Kids want chicken nuggets and pizza all day everyday- and that's not scratch cooking. We have to reintroduce them to that style of food. Again, this is regional and some kids in different regions are more adventurous than others. 
I know this comment period is not about smart snacks but I can't not mention how crazy backward they are. It's insane that we can scratch cook amazing tasty vegetables and bread dishes (homemade roll) but then can't sell the extras or have to tell students you can't have two because its not a ""smart snack"". It's crazy we can't sell excessive condiments to prevent students from over taking. By not selling them kids take more because we basically can't say no- this increases the total sodium on our weekly menus. So its hurting us both ways. Its crazy ice-cream is an acceptable snack but a bread stick is not. I agree we shouldn't be selling candy and crap but there's so many holes in the rule its crazy. I think the lobbyist had too much say, its too complicated, and it has drastically reduced income we desperately need to pay staff what they deserve. 
I'd like to add that I'm a Registered Dietitian and SNS certified. I believe in the NSLP. I think there's a bit too many regulations to make great menus. I think the regulations are confusing to staff and the public. We as directors then have to pick up the pieces. ",In favor of flexibilies

While I agree that we need to watch our sugar intake, make use of whole grain products, and watch sodium levels children shouldn't follow the same guidelines used for adults.

The products that are whole grain pasta and snacks are not appealing to adults so how can it be appealing to students.

The NSLP meal pattern guidelines were supposed to have been built on the American Dietetic Guidelines, but nowhere in those guidelines does it state that 100% of all grains consumed should be whole grain rich.  Further for some grains such as grits, tortilla, biscuits, etc. whole grains do not provide a palatable product.  Grits simply cannot be a whole grain, tortillas made from whole grains turn out like cardboard Frisbees, and whole grain biscuits are sometimes like hockey pucks.

2017,FNS-2017-0021-1997,nan,School,"Thirty million students depend on school meals as a key source of nutrition each day.  The most important part of this daily endeavor should include making meals students find appealing and will eat.  Familiarity is appealing to students.  With all the other challenges our vulnerable students are going through in the homes each evening why should there be restrictions to how many calories are provided in the National School Lunch Program?  I agree that there should be minimums set for the Meal Patterns that include a weekly variety of vegetables.  However, why should those calories be included in the maximum allowance?  Weight Watchers does not count fruit or vegetables towards your daily allowance.  On the other hand, why should the USDA limit the only wholesome meal with a maximum limit of calories and sodium?  I join SNA and urge Congress to monitor USDAs efforts to provide school meal program flexibility.  The USDA should allow for more local control.  I support practical flexibility under federal regulations to ease menu-planning challenges.  At most, the USDA should maintain Target 1 sodium levels in the NSLP and SBP and I encourage the USDA to restore the initial requirement that at least half of grains offered through school meals be whole grain rich.  I agree that the State agencies should continue granting and SFAs exemption request to use specific alternative grain products if the SFA can demonstrate hardship(s) in procuring, preparing, or serving specific products that are acceptable to students.     
As Congress drafts a new Farm Bill, I agree with the SNA to call for passage of H.R. 3738, the Healthy Breakfasts Help Kids Learn Act.  The bipartisan bill would expand USDA Foods, or commodities, to support school breakfast.  Research has shown that school breakfast consumption supports students academic achievement, improved classroom behavior and attendance.  Universal Breakfast has worked substantially well in our Indiana school district.  Students that do not receive meals at home eagerly consume breakfast each morning without charge.  Breakfast in our district is the most important meal of the day-educationally and nutritionally.  A key piece of boosting childrens well-being and improving schools is to ensure that each child can start the day right with a healthy breakfast at school.  Students reap the academic and nutritional benefits of the meal.  Numerous studies show that breakfast improves learning and attendance, and reduces behavior problems and tardiness.  Children who eat breakfast at school-closer to test-taking time-perform better on standardize tests than those who skip breakfast or eat breakfast at home.
I join SNA (School Nutrition Association) in their call on Congress to oppose any school meal block grant proposal and provide greater support to school nutrition programs, which contribute to the health and academic success of the students of the United States.  Fixed-sum block grants would leave school meal programs without adequate funding to support students in urgent need of assistance following unanticipated financial hardships, or communities affected by natural disasters.

2017,FNS-2017-0021-4892,nan,School,"     I am a Food Services Supervisor for a small to medium sized school district in Washington state.  I am very familiar with these regulations, as I am the one who writes the menus for our district.
     As far as allowing 1% flavored milk, I don't really see a need to change from the regulations we have now.  Our district has had the current standards on the milk in place for over 9 years now, with no difficulty.
     On the matter of stepping back and requiring schools that only HALF of their grain items are whole grain rich is a very good idea.  Our experience has been that there are some whole grain rich items the students just won't accept.  I have tried in vain to find a whole grain rich biscuit that is acceptable to the students, but they just toss them into the garbage.  What a waste of our taxpayers' dollars!  If the food goes into the garbage, it is certainly not nourishing the children, or adding to their health in any way.  We have a high number of Free & Reduced qualified students in our district. Yet we still see so much wasted food.  
     Manufacturers have been making strides as far as the whole grain rich items, but for some items they still have quite a ways to go to be accepted by our customers, the students.
     As for the Sodium levels, I am in favor of keeping the Level 1 Sodium requirement, and not going any lower.  Again, manufacturers are working very hard on finding ways to add flavor without more sodium.  After all, the National School Lunch & Breakfast Programs are a huge, huge customer base for them, so they are highly motivated.
     Personally, I very seldom add salt to any of my own food as I eat. I am truly NOT a big salt user. Yet when I taste some of the low sodium foods we are serving the students, I think some of them are lacking flavor or need salt.  Our kitchens are set up here to use mostly manufactured foods, including a lot of USDA manufactured frozen foods.  The district I work for is really not set up as far as equipment and staff to do the ""Cooking from Scratch"" meals.  So I feel we need to keep Level 1 Sodium right where it is, and not go any lower, so that all districts can meet the required level.  When I write our menus, and run them through our software program that tracks all the requirements we must meet, we are barely squeaking by on the Sodium amounts now.

My school and myself are completely in favor or rolling back the USDA Nutrition standards to the first phase of the sodium restriction target.
I am a K-12 school and with offer vs serve I am having more students going hungry than ever before.  It was a good concept to try and get children to eat their fruit and vegetables.  But, since the implementation of this program our waste in the trash has doubled.  
Our school nurse has me buy saltines.  Everyday she is overrun with upset tummies because they are hungry.  Why are they hungry, they ate the 4 little chicken nuggets, but they did not like broccoli or the baked beans, and why can't they have 6 or 9 chicken nuggets like McDonalds.
The hardship is being put on the schools to try and make a fit community, when it is never going to happen as long as parents live in fast food restaurants.  Processed food is cheap and fast and convenient.  School children cannot tell you a peach from a pear because they do not get these items at home.
Myself and the school I work for are in favor of reducing sodium and introducing the children to whole grains, but the calorie and sodium restriction in the the second phase are difficult to meet and will be basically impossible on the 3rd phase unless all you serve is fresh fruit and vegetables.
Children need protein, adults need protein.  It is proven that all these carbs are producing obese and diabetic people.  Protein feeds the brain, protein keeps you fuller longer and protein builds muscle.
I know my school district would love to see the final rule be rolled back to the first phase. I wouldn't have as many hungry and angry students.

2017,FNS-2017-0021-5237,nan,School,"On behalf of the 57,000 members of the School Nutrition Association (SNA), we welcome the opportunity to comment on the publication of the Interim Final Rule on Child Nutrition Programs:  Flexibilities for Milk, Whole Grains and Sodium, published in the Federal Register on November 30, 2017. SNA appreciates the Department’s efforts to address the challenges school districts have confronted in transitioning to updated meal pattern requirements for the National School Lunch and School Breakfast Programs. While USDA’s regulatory flexibilities have aided in this transition, overall, school districts look forward to a permanent solution eliminating the onerous management of temporary rules and, where allowed, annual waivers. 
 
WHOLE GRAINS: A recent SNA survey found that despite widespread efforts to increase student acceptance of whole grain foods, 65 percent of responding school nutrition directors reported continued challenges with the current whole grain mandates. A majority of school meal programs struggle with students’ regional and cultural preferences for specific refined grains such as white rice, pasta, grits or tortillas.  
 
The most effective solution is to restore the initial requirement that at least half of grains offered with school meals be whole grain rich. USDA’s whole grain waivers have been a helpful interim step; however, several states do not readily offer the waiver to struggling schools, or have made the application process so cumbersome that schools overwhelmed by administrative duties are discouraged from applying. Overly burdensome requirements, including required documentation that some schools have no means to collect, have severely limited the availability of this much-needed regulatory relief. In addition, the waiver process consumes limited State Agency resources that would be better directed to providing technical assistance to school districts.  
 
SODIUM: Schools made significant progress in reducing sodium in school menus to meet Target 1 limits; however, a recent SNA survey revealed that 92 percent of responding school districts are concerned about the availability of foods that will meet future sodium limits and whether these will be acceptable by students. The Institute of Medicine warned that “reducing the sodium content of school meals as specified and in a way that is well accepted by students will present major challenges and may not be possible.” (School Meals: Building Blocks for Healthy Children, 2010)   Naturally occurring sodium present in meat, milk and other low-fat dairy foods will force

schools to take nutritious choices off the menu, and drive more students away from healthy school meals.  
 
Given the lack of scientific evidence to support these sodium targets for children, the uncertainty regarding the long-term effects of lower sodium diets on child development and overall health, and differences in the scientific and medical communities on the appropriate recommendations for sodium consumption, USDA should maintain Target 1 sodium levels and eliminate future targets.  
 
MILK: SNA continues to support student consumption of milk, which is a key source of protein and essential nutrients, and important to children’s growth and development. Offering an additional low-fat milk option sends a positive message on milk’s importance. Schools that choose to offer students this milk option should be required to continue to meet meal pattern limits on calories and saturated fat. By making this change as part of a final rule and eliminating exemption language, USDA will help streamline program operations.  
 
As always, we appreciate the opportunity to comment and hope to continue partnering with the Department to support the children served by these critical nutrition programs. 
 ",In favor of flexibilies
2017,FNS-2017-0021-5414,nan,School,"It would help to have a flavored milk with a 1% or even 2%. I propose a 2% unflavored milk and a 1% flavored milk. Students do not drink fat free at home so they can taste a difference when they drink it at school. They do not drink milk like they would if it tasted more like what they drink at home.
Sodium levels may be intended to make a healthier meal, but most times the result is a meal that kids do not eat. I think the bigger picture is to get the students to eat their breakfast and lunch. I propose that we can continue to cook without salt and offer salt packets so students can add salt if they want it. I think rinsing canned vegetables as a way to reduce salt distracts us from serving a good tasting meal to serving one that meets the regulations. 
Whole grain is also good, but students do not like the biscuits and most of the bread. Districts should have the flexibility to offer some white flour choices. This could be put to each state vote that XX items in that state can be served using a white flour. This would help in regions that have particular foods like biscuits in the south. Again  experts know the whole grains are healthier, but the students compare our food to what they eat at home and our food is different. ",In favor of flexibilies
2017,FNS-2017-0021-5886,nan,Advocacy,"The Nor-Cal Chapter of the California School Nutrition Association (CSNA) appreciates this opportunity to comment on
the interim final rule on meal flexibility. We also appreciate USDA’s willingness to provide these welcome flexibilities to
schools. CSNA is a professional organization with a membership of over 2,000 individuals who represent both school
food service employees and industry, and collectively serve over 5 million meals daily to children across the state. The
Nor-Cal Chapter of CSNA represents schools districts and industry in the greater San Francisco Bay Area region. On
behalf of our members, we offer the following comments:
Sodium
Nor-Cal CSNA supports maintaining the target 1 sodium level and extending the implementation of the target 2 level,
while continuing to support schools to increase scratch cooked menus and options. However, we also recommend that
target 2 be reevaluated based on current science-based research, as little scientific evidence exists to support further
reductions in sodium.
In general, schools and the industry that produces school food ingredients have found sodium target 1 to be reasonable
and easy to attain. Similarly, target 2 may not be an insurmountable challenge, though it may affect the ability of school
districts to offer cheese as part of school meals. However, schools and industry agree that target 3 is fundamentally
unattainable as it relies on risky changes to manufacturing processes that could use technologies or chemical substitutes
to offset sodium, without adequate time for evaluation.
We recommend that the regulations be amended to establish target 2 as the final sodium reduction, and reconsider
the target pending the final evaluation of the voluntary sodium standards currently under development at FDA at a
later date.
Whole Grains
Nor-Cal CSNA does not support extending the existing whole grain waiver option for schools because the process is
cumbersome and wastes resources at the school district and state level. Instead, we urge USDA to amend the whole
grain rules to require that 50% of grains served by schools meet the whole grain-rich definition. A 50% whole grain-rich
requirement would allow schools flexibility to sometimes offer white pasta, rice, or tortillas as part of balanced,
culturally appropriate, scratch cooked meals and ensure children have access to nutrient dense whole grains. Many
schools districts in California go beyond the current “whole grain-rich” requirements and serve 100% whole grain foods
and intact whole grains such as brown rice and quinoa. We strongly support offering these foods to students and
believe USDA should issue a final rule that allows schools the flexibility to design menus that both increase nutrient
dense foods served to students and meet the needs and expectations of California’s diverse student body.
We recommend that the regulations be amended to require that 50% of all bread/grain meal components meet the
definition of whole grain-rich.Milk
Nor-Cal CSNA appreciates the change that allows schools increased flexibility when serving milk in schools. While we
believe that milk is an excellent vehicle for delivering key nutrients and essential proteins to children, we also recognize
that sugar sweetened beverages, such as soda and juice, have been strongly associated with diet related diseases,
particularly among low income children and youth. Clearly, flavored milk, already allowed under the current
regulations, has added nutritional benefits when compared to soda and juice and Nor-Cal CSNA supports efforts to
increase children’s overall milk consumption.
Recent research published after issuance of the 2012 regulations has raised serious questions about whether fat is the
health risk that it was previously considered. Given the limits on calories and saturated fat in the menu planning
requirements, schools should be able to evaluate what milk options, flavored or unflavored, best fit within their menu
plan and meet student needs. Indeed, many school districts here in the Bay Area and beyond have successfully limited
or even eliminated flavored milk, and our organization believes that decisions about the types of milk offered in schools
are best made at the local level.
We recommend the elimination of all limits on the variety of milk, both flavored and unflavored, offered by schools,
including the full range of fat levels.
Additional Comments
Fresh Fruits and Vegetables
While not addressed under the current interim rule, we recommend that USDA eliminate the requirement for students
to take a half cup of fruit or vegetables with every meal. Further, we recommend USDA maintain all existing
requirements for offering fruits and vegetables, but offer schools the flexibility to fulfill the bean and legume
vegetable subgroup either as a vegetable or as meat/meat alternate. These changes will mitigate food costs and
waste, increase menu variety, and ensure students have access to produce. Here in California, many schools districts
have successfully increased fresh produce served to students through salad bars and farm to school programs, initiatives
our organization strongly supports. However, the increased cost and waste associated with the service mandate for
produce jeopardizes these vital programs in some school districts and negatively affects children’s perception of the
school meal program.
Oppose Block Grants
We recommend USDA strongly oppose block grants for school meal programs to ensure students across the country
continue to access nutritious school meals.
On behalf of the Nor-Cal Chapter of the California School Nutrition Association, we thank you for the opportunity to
provide these comments and look forward to continuing this dialog in the future.",In favor of flexibilies

following comments in support of the Interim Final Rule entitled “Child Nutrition Programs: Flexibilities
for Milk, Whole Grains, and Sodium Requirements as published in the November 30 edition of the
Federal Register. We strongly support1 extending through school year 2018–2019 these menu planning
flexibilities in the National School Lunch Program (NSLP); the School Breakfast Program (SBP); the Special
Milk Program for Children (SMP); and the Child and Adult Care Food Program (CACFP), and look forward
to the final rule this fall for implementation in SY 2019–2020. Our members – recipient agencies, state

We want to provide wholesome meals that will be sought out by all students, and respect the different needs
and preferences that result in successful programs around the country.
Sodium –
ACDA appreciates and has supported efforts to provide flexibility in school meal programs in each of the
past several years for which such flexibility has been offered. This rule retains Sodium Target 1 as the
regulatory limit in the NSLP and SBP through the end of SY 2018-2019, and anticipates retaining Target 1
in the final rule through at least the end of SY 2020-2021.
ACDA supports the interim rule, and urges reviewing the Target 2 sodium standard contingent upon the
latest scientific research indicating that further reduction in sodium is necessary to safeguard the health of
children.
During our annual meeting in Salt Lake City, Utah held May 3-5, 2015, we benefitted from presentations
made by Dr. Cheryl Anderson of the University of California, San Diego, who was a lead member of the
Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee (DGAC) with respect to the development of the sodium standards
recommendations. We also received a presentation from Dr. Robert P. Heaney of the Creighton University
Osteoporosis Research Center. These two experts provided differing views regarding the recommended
sodium standards.
Both cited the May 14, 2013 report of the Institute of Medicine saying that there is no evidence that reducing
the intake below 2300 mg per day is beneficial. Dr. Anderson reported that the 2015 DGAC determined
that, based on the two new studies identified in the updated search, changes were not warranted to the
2010 DGAC conclusion statement or grade. She went on to say that neither of the two studies identified in
the update found a relationship between dietary sodium intake and blood pressure in healthy, normotensive
children.Dr. Heaney discussed other studies that suggest “…the 2010 Dietary Guidelines for sodium were
incompatible with potassium guidelines and with nutritionally adequate diets.”2
 He also cited another study
questioning the link between cardiovascular disease and sodium intake.3
 Finally, he cited a recent study
by Boston University finding that salt had no long-term effect on blood pressure.4
We agree that the sodium standard issue should be reviewed as part of the 2020 Dietary Guidelines for
Americans, and any further modification in sodium standards for school meals should await that
determination.
Whole Grains –
We also appreciate the whole grain flexibility because various regions continue to experience problems
with specific items such as pasta, bagels, grits, biscuits, and tortillas. These food items are difficult to obtain
as whole grain rich products or are not readily accepted by students. Within your Federal Register notice
you rightly point out that the development of these products is time consuming and expensive, and
responsibly requires consumer acceptability testing to ensure that these products will be well received.
School Food Authorities routinely begin to ask for samples or test new products before ordering, so
sufficient lead time is essential – especially with respect to the ordering of USDA Foods that is routinely
done well in advance of the actual school year.
Dairy –
ACDA supports the rule that allows program operators in the NSLP, SBP, SMP, and CACFP (the Child
Nutrition Programs (CNPs)) the option to offer flavored, low-fat (1 percent fat) milk as part of a reimbursable
meal for students in grades K through 12, and for SMP and CACFP participants 6 years of age and older.
Schools may also offer flavored, low-fat milk as a competitive beverage for sale. This optional flexibility
expands the variety of milk in the CNPs and may encourage children’s consumption of fluid milk nationwide.
While the existing flexibility authorized under section 747(c) of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017,
allowed State agencies the discretion to grant SFAs exemptions allowing service of low-fat flavored milk,
individual states had discretion to not allow exemptions and if they did allow exemptions schools had to
demonstrate hardship by documenting a reduction in student milk consumption.
Again, we thank you for the opportunity to offer these comments, and look forward to continue working with
you to enhance the quality and substance of the nutrition standards that serve as the basis for USDA’s food
programs. ",In favor of flexibilies
2017,FNS-2017-0021-6278,nan,Manufacturer/food industry,"These comments are submitted on behalf of National Dairy Council (NDC) in response to the interim
final rule entitled “Child Nutrition Programs: Flexibilities for Milk, Whole Grains, and Sodium
Requirements” and published in the Federal Register of November 30, 2017 (1). In particular, the
present comments will discuss the decision by the Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) of the U.S.
Department of Agriculture (USDA) to again permit schools to offer flavored milk in both low-fat (1
percent) and fat-free varieties. The comments will discuss milk consumption in the National School
Lunch Program (NSLP), the School Breakfast Program (SBP), the Summer Food Service Program (SFSP),
the Child and Adult Care Food Program (CACFP) and the Special Milk Program (SMP).
NDC, the non-profit organization founded by U.S. dairy farmers, is committed to nutrition research and
education about dairy’s role in the diet and in health and wellness. NDC provides science-based dairy
nutrition, food safety and product development information to, and in collaboration with, a variety of
stakeholders committed to fostering a healthier nation, including health professionals, educators, school
nutrition directors, academia and industry. Established in 1915, NDC comprises a staff of registered
dietitians, nutrition research, product development, food safety and communications experts across the
country. NDC is committed to helping improve children’s health and wellness through programs such as
Fuel Up to Play 60, which encourages youth to consume nutrient-rich foods and achieve at least 60
minutes of physical activity each day.
Overview of the Proposed Rule
Although these comments focus primarily on fluid milk, FNS is proposing two other regulatory
adjustments, covering requirements for minimum whole grain content and maximum sodium content in
school meals. In describing the three “flexibilities,” FNS states that it is responding to schools’ need for
“more flexibility to accommodate menu planning and procurement challenges, local operational 
2
differences, and community preferences” (1). FNS also states its aim that schools be able “to plan and
serve meals that are economically feasible and acceptable to their students and communities” (1). The
agency recognizes that the palatability and acceptability of nutritious foods is a major factor in
determining whether students consume and are nourished by the foods that are offered to them.
Role of Milk in School Nutrition Programs
Milk has been an integral part of federal school meals from the very beginning. Federally-supported
school milk programs in Chicago and New York City actually pre-dated the creation of what is now the
NSLP in 1946. As the lunch program expanded, school milk consumption grew tenfold between 1946
and 1969 (2).
Today, milk must be offered with each school lunch and breakfast, as well as with summer meals and
certain other nutrition programs (3). In the school-based programs, students at the secondary level (and
some elementary students) may refuse milk as long as they take a sufficient number of other meal
components. Data from the School Nutrition Dietary Analysis IV, analyzed by the National Dairy Council,
suggests that during the 2009-10 school year, about 85% of students participating in the NSLP took milk
on a given day, as did about 76% of students in the SBP (2).
Legal and Regulatory Requirements for School Milk
Milk served in the school meal programs is required by law to be “consistent with the most recent
Dietary Guidelines for Americans” (4). The 2015-2020 DGA recommendslow-fat or fat-free milk (5). Both
low-fat and fat-free flavored milk could be considered “consistent” with the DGA, meeting the legal
requirement. The requirement in regulations, from 2012 until promulgation of the interim final rule, for
all flavored milk to be fat-free was a policy choice within FNS’s discretion, but it was not required by the
relevant statutory language.
The law permits “flavored and unflavored” milk in schools (4). The 2015-2020 DGA recognizes that
“[s]ome sweetened milk and yogurt products may be included in a healthy eating pattern as long as the
total amount of added sugars consumed does not exceed the limit for added sugars, and the eating
pattern does not exceed calorie limits” (5).
Dairy Under-Consumption and School Meals
The DGA recommends three servings of dairy foods daily for those 9 years and older in the Healthy U.S.-
Style Eating Pattern, 2-1/2 servings for children ages 4 to 8, and two servings for children ages 2 to 3.
Most Americans do not meet current dairy food recommendations (6).
3
• According to the DGA, all age groups 4 years and older, of both genders, do not meet
recommendations for dairy consumption.
• School-age males and females consume less than recommended amounts, with females’
consumption lower than males’ in the 9-13 and 14-18 age groups (5).
School meals offer a means of addressing children not meeting recommendations for dairy food, which
is a matter of nutritional and public health concern. Dairy foods are important sources of three of the
four nutrients identified by the DGA as being of public health concern because of under-consumption:
calcium, vitamin D and potassium (7). Milk is the leading food source of nine essential nutrients in the
diets of children and adolescents ages 2-18, including protein, calcium, phosphorus, potassium,
magnesium, vitamins A, B12, D and riboflavin (8). The 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines healthy eating
patterns, which include low-fat and fat-free dairy foods, are associated with reduced risk for several
chronic diseases, including cardiovascular disease (strong evidence) and type 2 diabetes (moderate
evidence) (5). Dairy consumption is also linked to improved bone health, especially in children and
adolescents(5).
Role of Flavored Milk in School Meals
Flavored milk can play a significant role in helping school children meet recommended dairy
consumption, in as much as a large portion of milk served in the schools is flavored (9). Research shows
that school-aged children who drink flavored milk do not have higher added sugarsintakes compared to
children who do not drink milk (10). Children and adolescents ages 2-18 who drink flavored milk have
higher total milk intakes than those who drink only unflavored milk (11). Flavored milk contributes about
4% of the added sugars in children’s diets, on average (7).
From the standpoint of total calories, there is not a large difference between low-fat and fat-free
flavored milk. FNS states in the preamble to the interim final rule that fat-free flavored milk contains
“approximately 20-40 calories less per serving” than the low-fat equivalent (1).
Flavored milk in schools contains significantly less added sugarsthan just a few years ago. According to
the annual school survey conducted by the Milk Processor Education Program, the average 8-ounce
serving of flavored milk contained 16.7 grams of added sugars in school year 2006-07, but only 7.5
grams in 2015-2016, a reduction of 55 percent (12). The lower sugar content reflects cooperative efforts
by schools and fluid milk processors. School districts have worked to include a variety of foods in
compliance with limits on total calories, averaged over a week (13). The minimal additional calories in
flavored milk would be included in these weekly calculations. FNS cites data showing that “roughly a
third of schools are well within the weekly calories maximums” and some schools are actually below the
minimum levels (1).
By definition, low-fat contains more fat than does fat-free milk per 8 oz. serving. However, recent
science continues to show that consumption of dairy products at all fat levels makes important
contributions to nutrient intake and can be incorporated into healthy dietary patterns (14). Additionally, 
4
a 2016 review paper indicates there is high-quality evidence that consumption of low-fat, regular or
high-fat dairy food is not associated with increased risk for coronary artery disease (CAD) (15). Because
the studies are observational, more data are needed to understand the associations. In addition, by
virtue of the health effects being studied (CVD), this research is chiefly in adults rather than children or
adolescents(16). Nevertheless, the emerging science is highly relevant to nutrition guidance, including
the DGA.
Declining School Milk Consumption
Before the 2012 regulations took effect, as FNS notes, low-fat flavored milk was the most frequently
offered variety by school districts. Since then, FNS states that it has observed “a decline in milk
consumption during lunch among NSLP participants from SY 2004-4005,” and adds that this occurred
among “elementary, middle, and high school students” (1). Although FNS has not yet published the data
on which this statement was based, the finding is consistent with the MilkPEP survey cited above, which
found that the volume of milk in schools in 2015-2016 was 9 percent below the level in 2011-2012, the
year before FNS required all flavored milk to be fat-free (12).
The percentage decline reported by MilkPEP is greater than the corresponding decline in average daily
participation (ADP) in the NSLP during the same period. The latter fell about 4 percent (17). Thus, milk
consumption in the NSLP would have been expected to decline in these years, since fewer students ate
lunch in the cafeteria, but it appears to have declined more than proportionately.
The fact that milk consumption seems to have declined more than ADP suggests – though it does not
prove – that students may have liked the milk less after the 2012 regulatory changes than before. In
these regulations, the only change specific to milk was the elimination of low-fat flavored milk. On the
other hand, other contemporaneous regulatory changes could have had an indirect effect. For example,
students are now required to take (not simply be offered) a fruit or vegetable, and school nutrition
personnel may have emphasized this requirement where previously they might have encouraged
students to take milk. The newly-mandated availability of water, while it does not alter the requirement
to offer milk, may have been seen as a beverage substitute by some students. Finally, the limited
amounts of time typically provided to eat lunch could have resulted in more time devoted to consuming
other meal components selected, and less to drinking milk (18).
Impact of the Interim Final Rule
Restoring low-fat flavored milk as an option could have several impacts:
Schools will have additional choices. Under the interim final rule, no school is compelled to offer lowfat flavored milk. A school district may choose to continue offering fat-free varieties, may decide to 
5
switch to low-fat flavored, or conceivably might procure both low-fat and fat-free flavored milk as well
as unflavored milk. In all cases, schools will have an option which they presently lack.
School milk consumption may increase.If this occurs, it would have positive implications in helping
children meet 2015-2020 DGA dairy food recommendations, their nutrient intakes, and their health.
Milk’s unique nutrient package can be difficult to replace in a healthy dietary pattern (19), so options
that might promote adequate milk consumption could increase the likelihood of nutrient adequacy and
help close the nutrient of concern intake gap among students (11).
ADP could increase. Many factors enter into ADP, most of them unrelated to milk. However, it has been
shown that improving students’ milk experience can increase ADP (20). While this research involved
interventions other than a change in fat level (additional flavors, merchandising, packaging and serving
temperature), it did demonstrate that the student milk experience can, in some situations, be powerful
enough to attract more students into the cafeteria.

2017,FNS-2017-0021-6644,nan,Manufacturer/food industry,"Chobani, LLC (“Chobani”) appreciates the opportunity to provide comments on the “Child Nutrition 
Programs: Flexibilities for Milk, Whole Grains, and Sodium Requirements.”
Company Background 
As the maker of America's No. 1-selling Greek Yogurt brand and the second largest yogurt manufacturer 
in the U.S., Chobani, LLC (“Chobani”) was founded on the belief that people have great taste – they just 
need great options. For this reason, Chobani produces authentically strained yogurt made with only 
natural, non-GMO ingredients. Our unique straining process results in products with naturally twice the 
amount of protein compared to regular, unstrained yogurt
*
, while maintaining an array of essential 
nutrients – including calcium, potassium, magnesium, B vitamins, and more. 
At Chobani, we are on a mission to make universal wellness happen sooner, especially for children. 
That’s why we’re proud to offer our nutrient-dense yogurt products as an approved component of 
school meals. Yogurt in school meals came about after a highly successful USDA-endorsed pilot in the 
National School Lunch Program (NSLP), in which our Greek Yogurt was shown to have great acceptance 
and high demand among school-aged children and school meal providers. Through this effort, strained, high-protein yogurt (i.e., Greek Yogurt) became a permanent creditable offering for the meat/meat 
alternate contribution of school meals, as well as a creditable option for the Smart Snacks in Schools 
program.  Today, nearly 2 million Chobani yogurts are bid for in the NSLP, helping to bring more dairy
and essential nutrients to children’s diets.
Regarding USDA’s Milk Flexibilities Request
Chobani supports the decision of the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), Food and Nutrition Service 
(FNS) to allow flavored, low-fat (1-percent fat) milk in the Child Nutrition Programs. We recommend 
extending this offering, along with other nutritious dairy beverage options like drinkable yogurt, on a 
permanent basis to ensure more nutrient-rich dairy beverage options are available to children in the 
long-term. The actions from the 2010 Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act (HHFKA) have made a positive 
impact on the nutritional value of school food offerings over the last few years. But with children 
continuing to fall short on dairy recommendations,1 increasing the availability of healthful options is 
needed to shift children towards healthy patterns aligned with the 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for 
Americans (DGA). 
Increasing availability to flavored, low-fat milk and other nutrient-dense dairy drinks is a good way to 
improve children’s access to nutritious dairy. Past interventions focused on improving food availability 
and access have shown a positive effect on student consumption rates. For example, USDA guidance to 
make plain, potable water available during mealtime can improve the proportion of children consuming 
water.
3 And because of the HHFKA standards that increased availability of fruit and vegetables, kids are 
now eating 16 percent more vegetables and 23 percent more fruit at lunch.4 Similar interventions are 
needed to increase dairy consumption to bring children closer to DGA recommendations and help them 
adopt life-long healthy habits.
Improving access to nutritious offerings in school meals is important not just from a physiological 
standpoint, but also as an opportunity for nutrition education. After all, school nutrition programs have 
an outsized role in signaling social norms, such as introducing children to the types of foods and 
beverages that should be included in a healthy diet. Moreover, as the marketplace grows and evolves to 
include nutritious innovations, the NSLP must modernize to recognize these options. Drinkable yogurt, 
for example, has grown more popular in the last decade, reaching over $800 million in sales in the US 
annually2
, and is oftentimes consumed as a replacement for milk. Including such options within the 
program allow students to have access to familiar options they may prefer, yet still signal that these are 
nutritious, normative choices. It is thus essential that school meals provide a visual representation of a 
healthy eating pattern aligned with DGA recommendations to help children learn and adopt lifelong
healthy eating habits. The Benefits of Dairy for Children
The 2010 and 2015-2020 DGA recommend low-fat and fat-free dairy as a key element of a healthy 
dietary pattern, given the essential nutrients dairy foods contribute. For children, dairy provides
important shortfall nutrients that are key to growth and bone health, including calcium, magnesium,
potassium, and vitamin D, among others. Children who consume dairy foods, including flavored milks, 
are less likely to fall short of the recommended intakes for certain nutrients, including calcium and 
magnesium.5,6 Yet dairy consumption, and thus the key nutrients for which it contributes, is declining 
among children.
7 There is thus a critical need to expand dairy offerings in Child Nutrition Programs to 
prompt intake of the nutrients kids need to grow and thrive.
The successful school lunch yogurt pilot in 2013-2015, which Chobani initiated, is evidence that offering 
dairy in alternate forms, like Greek Yogurt, is well-accepted by students. Because of this pilot, school 
nutrition directors have noted that students often prefer Greek Yogurt over regular, and that this 
preference has helped to reduce plate waste. This shows that increasing the dairy options available, 
such as through flavored milk offerings, is a good way to help improve children’s consumption of this 
critical food group.
Improve Consumption by Expanding Offerings in School Meals
Science and public health authorities support the role of flavored milk in improving children’s diets. For 
example, studies show that children and adolescents who include flavored milk in their diet have greater 
intakes of both milk and calcium.
8 The American Heart Association (AHA) explains in a recent scientific 
statement that sweetened dairy products have a positive impact on diet quality.9 The reason for this is 
that a small of amount of sweetness increases the palatability, enjoyment, and consumption of nutrientrich food items. Similarly, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) supports flavored milks in schools –
as they state, “consumed within recommended calorie amounts, sweetness can offer an effective tool to 
promote consumption of nutrient-dense foods and beverages.”
10 Furthermore, science shows that 
consuming unflavored milk is not associated with unfavorable health effects in children, like excess 
weight.11
The inclusion of flavored milk is not only supported by science and prominent authorities, it is also 
supported by current dietary guidance. The 2015-2020 DGA recommendations acknowledge that 
healthy eating patterns can accommodate nutrient-dense foods with a small amount of added sugars –
like flavored milks.
1 As such, there is an important place for flavored milks in children’s diets.
While the current NSLP and Smart Snacks in Schools programs allow flavored milk, limiting the flavored 
milk options to only non-fat restricts the many nutrient dense, low-fat dairy-based beverages that can 
be used to improve children’s diets. It is therefore important to extend this option to include low-fat 
flavored milk to provide children with even more options for meeting nutrient needs and dairy 
recommendations. Further, it is strongly recommended that program guidelines are abreast of the evolving science and 
recommendations – including the movement away from a low-fat recommendation. It is well-known 
that appropriate fat intake, within the recommended calories and context of a healthy diet pattern,
contributes to growth and brain development in adolescents and promotes satiety, which is an 
especially important factor for performance in school. Further, research shows that the fat in dairy may 
be beneficial, since higher intake of saturated fat in dairy is associated with lower cardiovascular disease 
risk.
12
Expanding Choices Beyond Fluid Milk
In addition to milk, yogurt – including strained, high-protein Greek Yogurt and non-Greek yogurt, and 
drinkable Greek Yogurt varieties – is a good, nutrient-dense dairy form for children. Yogurt is
recommended by the DGA as an alternative to fluid milk, given its ability to deliver key nutrients, and 
the Chobani-inspired pilot program showed that Greek Yogurt is a well-accepted option by students.
Given this high acceptability, USDA should consider expanding current Child Nutrition Program 
standards to also include Greek Yogurt beverages as a nutrient-dense option to improve children’s 
nutritional intakes.
Since October 2017, yogurt has been allowed as a fluid milk substitute for adults in the Child and Adult 
Care Food Program (CACFP)13 to offer greater flexibility and encourage consumption of calcium-rich 
foods in participants. Given that authentically strained Greek Yogurt provides double the protein of 
regular, unstrained yogurt,† and it is a good source of calcium, excellent source of B-vitamins and 
includes many other important attributes – like potassium, magnesium and live and active cultures –  
allowing Greek Yogurt beverage substitutions needs to be considered for children in Child Nutrition 
Programs as well.
What’s more, it is important that FNS’ school meal and snack offerings are periodically reassessed to (1) 
keep pace with the marketplace and (2) ensure products demonstrate acceptability among consumers 
and students. Drinkable yogurt sales have exceeded $800 million2
, signaling that such beverages are 
now a fixture in the marketplace and a popular choice among consumers. School meal and snack 
offerings should be expanded to include familiar products offered in the marketplace to meet student
preferences.
Further, there is increased understanding about the adverse health effects of nutrient-lacking sugarsweetened beverages on child health. A recent report from the National Academies of Sciences, 
Engineering and Medicine notes that sugar-sweetened beverage consumption is now widespread about 
young children and that the evidence is “quite strong” to support curbing intake to positively impact children’s weight.  To support reduction in sugar-sweetened beverage consumption, there should be 
additional options in schools, beyond water, to promote shifts to healthier habits. While water is one 
part of the solution, children still struggle to meet nutrient needs. This means that nutrient-dense 
beverages, such as flavored milk and Greek Yogurt beverages, are also needed to fill the gap of nutrients 
of public health concern. School nutrition program guidelines should therefore shift to encourage
consumption of nutrient-dense beverages, such as Chobani Greek Yogurt drink, which can promote the 
development of healthy drink habits over sugar-sweetened beverages.14
Summary
In conclusion, given the role low-fat, flavored milk and naturally nutrient-dense yogurt beverages could 
play to improve dairy consumption rates and improve nutrient intakes of children, it is strongly advised 
to include these options as a permanent part of the reimbursable school meal program, including the 
NSLP, School Breakfast Program (SBP) and Smart Snacks in Schools program.

2017,FNS-2017-0021-7521,nan,School,"As a School Lunch Director for many years I applaud the changes that are being made.  I would love to have a magic wand that I could twirl over the children's head and make them eat healthy.  Unfortunately, there is no such thing.  Healthy eating has to begin at a young age.  When children enter school at age 3-5 nutrition education should start.  Trying new foods should be part of this education.  I also believe that most diseases are due to what we eat or don't eat.  This needs to be tied in with the education.
Students take vegetables or fruit and throw them away.  They don't like the whole grain bread, rolls, or pasta.  Our sales suffer because of this.  They then go home and eat what ever they want to.  I believe as a school we should teach healthy eating.  We should offer healthy alternatives daily. The problem is the students who won't get lunch because they don't like the healthy meals.  This is an even bigger concern to me.
The whole whole grain bit bothers me because as we all should know by now breads are not what we should be pushing students to eat.  All bread turns to sugar immediately and makes us crave more.  We have more and more students with Celiac Disease or who are Gluten intolerant than ever before.  This was a disease 20 years ago that primarily started around age 40.  I say get rid of the whole grains completely. 
As far as sodium goes I don't think this should be lowered any further.  It is a nightmare now trying to do menus.  I worked in a Long Term Care Facility and did their menus for over ten years.  It was easier to do the 8 diet menus there than to do the menus for the school district.  
We should go back to moderation.  A Serving of meat, vegetable, grain, fruit and milk.  
Simple and it works.  No one ever got fat off of school lunches.  Sitting around  and eating junk food after school and on the weekends is how children got fat.

2017,FNS-2017-0021-7657,nan,Manufacturer/food industry,"The National Turkey Federation (NTF) appreciates the opportunity to submit the 
following comments to the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) Food, Nutrition 
and Consumer Service’s (FNCS) in response to the Interim Final Rule. NTF 
represents nearly 100 percent of all turkey processors, growers, breeders, hatchery 
owners and allied companies. It is the only national trade association representing 
the turkey industry exclusively. NTF and its members are pleased to work with 
USDA and individual school districts to provide school meals that are not only 
nutritious but also taste good.
Turkey is a lean, nutrient rich protein choice for children.
The 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans advises that a healthy diet includes 
""A variety of protein foods, including seafood, lean meats and poultry, eggs, legumes 
(beans and peas), and nuts, seeds, and soy products.”i Protein is essential for the 
development and maintenance of muscle, including brain development. Yet, 
according to What We Eat in America, NHANES 2007-2010, approximately 50% of 
boys and girls 9-13 years of age are not meeting their protein requirement, meeting 
only, on average, 4.1oz equivalents of the recommended 4-6oz needed. The problem 
is even worse as girls get older. Over 70% of girls aged 14-18 are not meeting their 
protein intake, meeting only, on average, 4.2oz equivalents of the recommended 5-
6.5.
ii This is further corroborated by the National Growth and Health Study, which 
found that “more than 75% [of girls] consumed less than the recommended amounts 
in the “meat” group” leading to nutrient disparities in the vast majority of schoolaged girls.iii This protein deficiency is quite troubling and one we urge the USDA 
to consider as it makes further changes to the school meals programs.
As a low-fat, high-protein option, turkey is an excellent protein choice for school 
meals. In fact, one 3.5 ounce (100 gram) serving of boneless, skinless turkey breast 
contains about 25 grams of protein, <1 gram of fat and 0 grams of saturated fat and 
children like it. Turkey is also a strong source of niacin, vitamin B6, and phosphorus 
and a good source of B5, zinc as well as of iron and potassium; all of which are 
important nutrients for school age children.iv

USDA should maintain sodium target 1 at least through SY 2020-2021 to allow 
for finalization and review of the National Academy of Medicine report on the
Dietary Reference Intake for sodium and potassium
It is vitally important for scientific consensus to be the basis for our policies, 
especially regarding vulnerable populations such as school-aged children. The most 
recent dietary reference intake (DRI) for sodium was set in 2005 at 2,300 mg and 
the data was extrapolated from adult adequate intakes to estimate for children; but 
a robust amount of emerging data over the last few years calls this number into 
question.v We believe that regulations on sodium, such as the sodium targets set for 
the school meals programs, should be informed by the most recent, relevant, and 
accurate scientific research and analyses available. To this point, we support an 
update to the sodium and potassium DRI and are pleased to see that one is in 
progress. 
The DRI is of utmost importance as it will set the stage for all federal and state level 
nutrition policies.  Maintaining the target 1 sodium reduction in school meals until 
the scientific review is complete will help ensure that we are developing policies 
based on science rather than long-held beliefs. We urge FNCS to keep tier 1 sodium 
in place until at least the end of SY 2020-2021, as indicated is USDA’s intent in 
the IFR, to give certainty regarding the timeline while a thorough review of the 
science is completed, at which point we will better understand the impact 
(positive or negative) of sodium reduction will have one children.

comment on the interim final rule on meal flexibility. We also appreciate the agency’s
willingness to provide these welcome flexibilities to schools.
CSNA has long been in the vanguard in promoting and providing healthy meals to
children in school. Following the last major revision in school meal patterns in 1995,
CSNA worked closely with the Nutrition Services Division of the California Department
of Education in piloting two alternative approaches to menu planning resulting in the
highly successful SHAPE California system. SHAPE was explicitly identified as an
acceptable alternative under the fifth menu option – Any Reasonable Approach –
authorized by Congress.
It is also worth discussing several historical points as we look at the new menu
planning requirements. The 1995 revision made extraordinary changes to the way
schools plan menus including a requirement that all schools use Nutrient Standard
Menu Planning (NSMP). While radical, the approach had been tested in a small
number of schools for several years. Despite some adverse findings during the pilot
phase, USDA went forward with the regulations. That said, unlike the current meal
requirements, the approach had gone through some field testing. Congress responded
by requiring USDA to amend the regulation to include food-based menu planning
options as well as the aforementioned any reasonable approach.
In commenting on the proposed regulations in 1995, CSNA made a number of
observations about the challenges and weaknesses of NSMP. It is worth noting that
the issues identified by CSNA are, in fact, the same reasons that the Institute of
Medicine (IOM) and later USDA used in eliminating NSMP in the current rules. The
lesson is that USDA might pay more attention to the comments of real world operators
when making significant changes to the basic structure of the meal programs. A great
deal of resources, both financial and human, could have been saved had USDA paid
heed to the comments received in 1995.
Which brings us to the current menu planning requirements. As mentioned above,
the 2012 regulation instituted menu planning requirements based on a report by the
IOM without the benefit of pilot testing. First, in its final report, School Meals: Building
Blocks for Healthy Children, the IOM clearly stated that it was responding to the
specific request for meal requirements based on the current understanding of
nutrition science. They stated that the report was not intended to be a policy
recommendation, noting that the resulting menu planning system may not be
practical, cost effective or acceptable to children.
The untested menu planning system put in place subsequent to publishing the final
regulation in 2012, was immediately found to be seriously flawed as evidenced by the
quick reversal of the requirement of caps on meat/meat alternate and bread/grain
servings. The caps added unnecessary and redundant complexity and costs.
The flexibilities provided in the new interim final rule are further recognition that the
initial requirements, while well intentioned, were not realistic or reasonable. We
support these changes and at a minimum recommend that they not be limited in
duration as provided in the rule, but be made permanent changes to the regulations.
That said, we believe that this rule provides an opportunity to make additional
changes, and CSNA offers the following:
Milk
CSNA appreciates the flexibility that allows schools to offer 1% flavored milk. We
believe that milk is an excellent vehicle for delivering key nutrients and essential
proteins to children, and any effort to increase children selecting and drinking more
milk is beneficial. The small amount of additional sugar in flavored milk should not
be a reason for policies that may inhibit milk consumption.
Furthermore, recent research published after the IOM report and issuance of the 2012
regulations, has raised serious questions about whether fat is the health risk that it
had previously been thought to be. Given the limits on calories and saturated fat in
the menu planning requirements, schools should be able to evaluate what fits within
their menu plan without the additional limitations imposed on milk choices.
CSNA recommends the elimination of all limits on the variety of milk, both
flavored and unflavored, offered by schools, including the full range of fat levels.
Whole Grain-Rich
CSNA recognizes the value of whole grain-rich bread/grain foods in diets and supports
efforts to increase their use in school meals. However, the requirement that all
bread/grain items on school menus be whole grain-rich is costly and unrealistic. As
policies issued subsequent to publication of the final rule demonstrate, among other
things, there are some popular food items, including foods that fit within a variety of
cultures, that cannot be easily produced as acceptable alternatives to their traditional
ingredients. And, while the cost of whole grain-rich items is declining as demand
increases, they still add cost to the meal.
The option offered in the interim final rule of extending the allowance of state issued
waivers is unacceptable. Some reports have focused on the low waiver request rate as
evidence that the need is small. These reports fail to explore why that is the case. The
waiver request process is burdensome at best. The low rate is likely not due to low
need, but to limited resources to request the waivers.
This is a good time to point out that the new menu planning requirements have added
considerable cost to school meals without a sufficient offsetting increase in meal
reimbursements. This effect has been most pronounced in schools with lower free and
reduced-price meal participation. The cost burden has been born by school district
general funds to the detriment of other education programs.
CSNA recommends that the regulations be amended to make the requirement be
that 50% of all bread/grain meal components meet the definition of whole grainrich.
Sodium
Perhaps the most controversial element of the current menu planning rule is the
reduction of sodium. CSNA supports the interim final rule’s extension of the
implementation at the target 2 level and, at a minimum, recommends that this be
made the permanent level going forward. However, we also believe that even this
target needs to be reevaluated based on current science-based research.
There has been considerable discussion over the past several years about what the
appropriate recommendation for sodium in diets should be. The 2,300 mg/day goal
identified in the Dietary Guidelines for Americans and endorsed by the Word Health
Organization and other health proponents may be appropriate for the 1/3 of the
American population that is sodium sensitive. A study by the CDC found that, in fact,
low sodium actually increases morbidity and mortality for most people. Other studies
have pointed out that low potassium is a greater health risk than higher sodium
consumption. And many studies have used a range of 3,000 to 6,000 mg/day as the
ideal range for sodium consumption. Current consumption in the U.S. is about 3,300
mg/day, at the low end of this range. At the time the final rule was published, school
lunch as a proportion of daily consumption was consistent with this national figure.
Furthermore, there are serious concerns about sodium targets and sodium
alternatives as they relate to children. There is no research or evidence that the
current target levels are healthful for children, or the long-term effects of lower sodium
on child development or health. There is no evidence that reducing sodium
consumption in children has any impact on development of taste preferences for salty
foods as adults. And there is no research on the long-term health effects of the many
alternatives to sodium that industry is exploring to replace salt in production.
There is research to suggest that the health risks of hypertension have increased over
the past several decades while sodium consumption has been stable, suggesting that
the increase in high blood pressure is not related to sodium consumption, and that
the quick-fix of reducing sodium may not actually address the underlying cause.
In general, schools and the industry that provides the ingredients and food to them
have found sodium target 1 to be reasonable and easy to attain. Similarly, target two
may not be an insurmountable challenge, although it will impact the ability to
incorporate cheese into school menus, which is a concern. However, as USDA
admitted in the final rule published in 2012, target 3 is fundamentally unattainable.
It is of great concern that USDA published a rule that built in failure. It relies on
changes to manufacturing processes that could use technologies or chemical
substitutes that pose greater health risks than the sodium they would replace without
sufficient time to evaluate those risks, and without providing funds to offset the costs
of developing these alternate approaches.
CSNA recommends that the regulation be amended to establish target two as the
final sodium reduction, and reconsider the target pending the final evaluation of
the voluntary sodium standards currently under development at FDA at a later
date.
Fruits and Vegetables
While not addressed in the interim final rule, CSNA would like to comment on the
current meal pattern requirement for serving, not just offering, increased quantities of 
fruits and vegetables. These requirements have increased cost and waste in school
meal programs.
CSNA recognizes the importance of fruits and vegetables in children’s diets.
Anecdotally, schools are doing an amazing job of offering a wide variety of these foods
in attractive ways, and have seen significant increases in consumption of them.
However, for children who do not choose to take and eat the mandated minimum
quantity served as part of their school meal, the requirement increases cost and has a
negative impact on children’s perception of the meal program.
As mentioned above, the menu planning requirements have significantly increased the
cost of producing school meals without commensurate increases in reimbursements.
The cost estimates provided in the final rule of 2012, based on questionable
assumptions by the IOM, were that the cost of lunch would increase by 14¢, while
schools that offer them would receive an additional 6¢ in reimbursement. School
breakfast costs were estimated to increase by 23¢ for which no additional
reimbursement was provided. The cost of the additional fruit and vegetable
component contributes significantly to the increased cost of providing meals to
children.
CSNA recommends the elimination of the minimum service requirements for
fruit and vegetable components. Instead, we recommend incentives for
increasing fruits and vegetables by providing additional USDA Foods entitlement
funds dedicated to these foods, as well as other approaches to making them
more affordable.
Again, we thank you for the opportunity to provide these comments and look forward
to continuing this dialog in the future.",In favor of flexibilies
2017,FNS-2017-0021-0009,nan,Constituent,"My children hate the milk options at school.   They don't like to drink ""milk flavored"" water, flavored chocolate or unflavored.  They throw it away.  They cannot bring in water bottles to the cafeteria to be able to drink water.  2% milk would taste better and with the added fat would help the child feel full longer during the day.
Increasing the fruits and vegetable servings are great because the provide vitamins that some children might not otherwise get any where else.
As for the whole grains, if the schools cannot find the whole grain foods because the food manufactures aren't producing them, the schools should be able to serve what they can get without having to fill out some waiver. Also, until the majority of the population starts using whole grains for everything in their own homes the manufactures of these  foods won't push to come up with the new recipes required and thus making it harder for the schools to get what they need. Which leads to more waivers having to be filled out and less time on the actual school menus.
On a side note the federal government is overstepping is bounds when the law was introduced in 2012.  Forcing the schools to do this when the majority of the population isn't even doing it yet is in poor taste.  The schools will follow the trend of whole grains, less sodium, more fruits and veggies as more and more of the population does.  But until then, lay off the schools.  They have enough stress on them already without having to worry about breakfast and lunch.",In favor of flexibilies
2017,FNS-2017-0021-0013,nan,Constituent,"School's should be allowed to serve whole milk to students - studies have shown that people who consume whole milk are at a lower chance to develop diabetes.  Low-fat milk has added sugar to compensate for taste.  The excess sugar has been shown to increase the chance of heart disease and obesity. Flavorings are needed to compensate for taste - not to mention artificial food coloring. There is little evidence that low-fat milk is a healthier dietary choice - and more evidence that it is a worse dietary choice. 
Leave the salt restriction as is, or roll back the restriction - do not lower the amount of salt in our children's food anymore.  While low salt intake helps reduce blood pressure - low salt intake at the same time increases the risk of heart attacks and strokes.",In favor of flexibilies

We see so much food going into the trash everyday, it's a shame! Plus the kids are still hungry! If we could do like a 50/50 weekly choice on the whole grain, it would make a real difference.  We have to serve a lot of processed food because we are short handed in the kitchen, so we don't have much time to prepare healthier food choices, so we are doing the whole grain chicken nuggets and chicken strips which taste horrible! We have close to 600 children, but less than 200 eat in the cafeteria due to these changes! I have worked for the same school district for 20 years and I have never seen such a decline in students eating and an abundance of food going in to the trash! Please take into consideration that these kids eat whatever they want once they leave here, what we serve does not help if they are not eating it. Perhaps if they could choose between a healthy meal or one that is not as healthy, there would be more choices for them and they might not go home starving!",In favor of flexibilies

The biggest uproar came when lunch servers were forbidden to offer Ranch dressing on the days that pizza was on the menu. My friend works at a junior high school in this same district. Servers are required to give each student a 4"" Styrofoam bowl that had to be filled with vegetables. At the end of the line, the students were checked off if they had their black bowl filled. Most deposited the black bowl in the garbage before they sat down to eat. Cow dung may be filled with nutrients and fiber, but I'm not going to eat it.

And since it's in some cases, the only meal a day for some students, why not give them something that will actually capture their focus, and give them a full stomach? Brussel sprouts, whole grain (no butter) toast, Normandy vegetables is for the birds. Treat our kids better than prison population. It's our taxes that pay for public schools....fix the problem.

I do not believe that sugary milk should be served in schools at all, and that requiring 50% whole grains is really not a big ask, and has little effect on palatability. 
I do support extending or permanently keeping the flexibility on sodium, because I developed scratch made menus that met the final rule and they simply didn't taste good. Salt has been shown to be only marginally related to blood pressure, and while I support there being a reasonable limit, the final rule initially approved in the HHFKA is too low.

I ask, how is THAT nutritious?! The schools DO need more flexibility. All the current options have to be pre-packaged, and are full of preservatives. The schools actually need the flexibility & ability to COOK food. REAL and FRESH food. 
Now schooled at home, my children gladly eat roasted zucchini, sweet potato with local honey,  grilled chicken, and baby spinach salads. 
I support changes to the school lunch program IF said changes will actually improve the overall nutritional value - not just focused on sodium and whole grains. If an adult wouldn't eat it, why should we expect a 7 or 12 year old to? FYI, I never saw a school staff member eating the lunches. Food for thought.",In favor of flexibilies
2017,FNS-2017-0021-0057,nan,Manufacturer/food industry,"The grain exemption does not go far enough. The daily grain minimum requirement needs to be removed ENTIRELY. We provide school lunches for 300 schools in California, with several on the NSLP. Many of our gluten-free customers are not able to take advantage of our gluten-free offerings because of this daily grain minimum. For instance, a perfectly balanced meal with herb roasted chicken, sauteed zucchini, and roasted red potatoes cannot stand on it's own with a ""qualified grain"" as a result of the minimum. We therefore need to be supplement a perfectly good offering with a whole grain roll, which drives up cost and more often than not ends up in the trash. The same is true for our Shepherd's Pie. Fresh mashed potatoes, braised ground beef, whole kernel corn, and shredded cheddar cheese - plenty of carbohydrates from the potatoes and the corn, but again, doesn't meet the grain minimum because the potatoes and corn are not qualified grains.
The daily minimums should be completely eliminated, and the weekly minimums lowered. Grains should not be a necessary component, and especially given the rise in gluten-intolerant children. Eliminating this restriction would actually allow for healthier meals to be provided at a lower cost, while alleviating administrative burden. Please go further. Menu planning via legislation is an asinine concept that only further drives school food professionals into the grasp of big food, looking for ""help"" on compliant offerings. If we want to improve the quality of our meals, we should make it easier to cook them from scratch without having to run to the rule book to make sure it meets and arbitrary standard.

The main issue with current guidelines is that they lack any flexibility and have not helped do anything but fill dumpsters at school across the country.  Many of the our children at my high school have went from eating meals to skipping breakfast/lunch all together after the revamping of the nutrition program under the Obama Administration.  I am employed at what is considered a ""poverty"" area school where around 60% of children receive free/reduced meals daily.  We have a large percentage of students that only get food when they are at school during the week because their parents cannot afford breakfast or nightly meals.  The students I teach are only obtaining food when they are present within the school walls.  Unfortunately when the new guidelines rolled out several years ago, our meal purchases went down greatly.  Another main result of the changes was seen when you evaluated what was going in to the trashcan - students were tossing meals whole!  I literally mean meals were purchased, set down on a table, poked at and then tossed.  Children are staying hungry at school and coming home as hungry as they were when the day began.  I have been to the homes of several of my students and the conditions they live in are heartbreaking due to the condition of the home and lack of meals begin provided to them.
The children need the nutrients supplied here at school during the day and this isn't being done under the other nutrition guidelines.  I as an adult find the meals appalling and no taste - why should I expect a child to eat the meal if I wouldn't?  I hope these newly added liabilities will remain in effect longer than 2017/2018 and that the whole nutritional guidelines will be looked at.  Our children need meals they will eat because often we are providing the only food they will see each day.  I am not asking for junk food, chips or pies.  I am asking for meals that have flavor to them, foods that will get the children eating, and meals that will fill their stomachs so they are able to function during the day at school.  A lack of food leads to a lack of concentration and how can you conquer school if you are starving?",In favor of flexibilies

In addition, it DOES NOT toss out whole grains.  It allows state departments to give waivers to districts where it has been proven that suitable whole grain pastas, for example, are not possible to purchase at this time.

As a School District Nutrition Services employee I am happy to see some flexibility with regard to the standards set by the last administration.  While we always strive to provide healthy, nutrient rich meals we also want them to be appealing, and we recognize that we have a very diverse population with equally diverse eating habits.  In recognizing that diversity we cannot assume that the ""American way of eating is the only and correct way to ear healthy.""  Honestly, having worked in school kitchens for 8 of my 12 years with Portland Public Schools Nutrition Services I can tell you that our meals are not making students fat.  In fact, I've lost 50 lbs eating school breakfast and lunches (keeping the portion sizes in mind).  I am quite proud of our program.  Before I began working or PPS I assumed the meals were little more than glorified fast food but I soon discovered how wrong I was.  Our meals are not making these kids fat but those family sized bags of chips and 20 oz sodas and energy drinks I see tucked under their arms as they come through the line certainly are contributors.  As are the $1 items from McDonald's or Taco Bell I see many of them eating for breakfast.  Or, how about those chocolate sugary coffee drinks middle and high schoolers drink with their parents every day?  Also, as an individual and a parent I wonder just how realistic it is to lower sodium levels even further, or insist on whole grain for every grain item when most families do not eat that way at home?  I know in my own home we certainly try to eat in a healthy fashion - we eat a variety of fruits and veggies etc...but whole grain pasta, for example, has a gritty texture so we use traditional enriched pasta.  Fat free milk tends to be a bit watery tasting so we use 1%.  Most families are buying whatever is cheapest and most convenient which usually means higher sodium foods that render school meals tasteless altogether.  In that case, the students will either skip the meals altogether or supplement with cup of noodles or other junk because the meals are too bland or the portion sizes for a MS student are the same as one for a 3rd grader.",In favor of flexibilies

The terms ""foods that qualify as grains"" and ""whole grain rich"" disturb me. Both terms qualify as 'vague,' since neither is defined. The use of the term, ""Alternate Foods"" is just as disturbing and for the same reasons.

Salt - like sugar - should be used with caution in children's meals as both are virtually addictive and neither is helpful in mass quantity.

2017,FNS-2017-0021-0501,nan,Constituent,"Offering this flexibility for SFA's is a great way to enhance program strength.  Particularly when it comes to sodium and grain requirements, menu planning can feel like an uphill battle where you are locked in a very limited box.  Considering how laden with sodium all food items have become, the current sodium restrictions seem appropriate, especially considering that children are likely going home and eating foods that are exponentially higher in sodium than what is provided at school.  Severely limiting sodium (at target 2 and final target level) is an admirable goal for enhancing the health of the youth, but the current health crises goes far beyond sodium intake.  
Cutting the current sodium limits nearly in half would only limit SFA's options for foods and cut into menu diversity.  To put it simply, the more sodium we have to cut out and the more whole grains we have to include, the food becomes increasingly less appealing to the children.  It doesn't have to be this way, but with the current food market, that's the way it is.  Advancements in food engineering and technology could make a monumental difference in this aspect and change perceptions on healthy foods, but the current food market does NOT favor healthier food items.  Enforcing cuts to sodium and increases in whole grains at this time would only decrease participation in the NSBP & NSLP, and create problems for SFA's who need to redesign 180 days worth of breakfast and lunch menus with a very limited number of desirable food options for the children.

I have been with the Sacramento City Unified for 10 years.  The Whole Grain requirement while worthy does impact districts that are diverse such as ours with a high Asian population.

In addition the whole grain chow mien is also not a favorite.  A better solution may be to offer brown or white rice or chow mien and let the student choose or allow flexibility for 1 or 2 non-whole grain options per week?    For true flexiability a solution beyond a waiver needs to occur.  Asking districts to submit a waiver and knowing that California will deny it anyway keeps us from even trying.  We are building a central kitchen and looking forward to making our own pizza dough and dinner rolls.  The popularity of these items will depend on the success of a palatable whole grain flour.   It would be nice if the flour could be mixed or if on occasion a white enriched grain dinner roll could be served instead.   All you have to do is attend any school and see that the kids don't even select the whole grain dinner roll and therefore eat less, or they select it and toss it.

2017,FNS-2017-0021-1083,nan,Constituent,"Executive Summary  The implementation of this interim rule allowing flexibility in three main areas of school menu planning involving milk, whole grains, and sodium will be beneficial to children across the United States. Several positive effects brought upon by this rule include increase in student participation, improvement in students’ health and well-being, and decrease in loss of revenue in participating schools. As a proactive citizen, I believe that this rule is a practical step to help encourage and introduce students to eat nutritious meals and practice healthy lifestyles.  
 
Background Schools rely upon Child Nutrition Programs (CNP) to provide meals to students across the U.S. Such programs include the National School Lunch Program (NSLP) and the School Breakfast Program (SBP). About 30.4 million students rely on NSLP and 14.6 million students rely on SBP every day (“School Meal Trends & Stats,” 2017). The CNPs are also an avenue for many low-socioeconomic students to receive meals. From 2015-2016, about 21.6 million lowincome children participated in NSLP and about 12.1 million low-income students partook in the SBP (“National School Lunch Program,” 2017; School Breakfast Program,” 2017).  
 
Implications of Proposed Rule  The implementation of this rule upon CNPs will prove to be advantageous for schools and students across the U.S. The flexibilities granted for CNP menu planning operators include allowing flavored low-fat milk, non-whole grains to be included in food, and retaining the Sodium Target 1 (USDA, 2017).  
 
These flexibilities would be a step in the right direction to encourage and help increase children participation in school meal programs. Though the purpose of the prior stringent menu requirement was to facilitate healthier eating habits for children, this was not seen to be the case at some schools. One study indicated that though children were forced to choose healthy foods to eat, consumption of these foods was very low and about 56% of the students were actually throwing away the food (Cha, 2015). Consequently, students become hungry throughout the day, which impairs attention, cognitive processing, and academic performance (Michigan.gov, 2017). Furthermore, offering food that would be more appealing to children would most likely increase student participation in school meal purchases (Mecia, 2017). Additionally if more children participate in eating school meals, students would probably be less hungry during the day, which would enhance their academic performance.  
 
 By granting permission to CNPs to be more lenient in the menu planning, students would be more likely to eat foods that contain essential nutrients. For example, allowing schools to offer flavored low-fat milk to children would actually entice them to drink more milk and gain essential nutrients. Health officials may be under the impression that offering students flavored milk would contribute to the obesity crisis on the basis that it is unhealthy and has high sugar

content and calories. However flavored milk, such as chocolate milk, contains the same essential nutrients as regular white milk, and children who drink flavored milk do not have a higher BMI than those who drink regular milk (“Truth About Flavored Milk,” 2015). Also, the added sugar content in flavored milk is just 3% with the rest of the sugar content being naturally occurring lactose (“Truth About Flavored Milk,” 2015). Allowing schools to have the flexibility to offer flavored milk in schools would encourage students to make smart eating choices, such as drinking milk rather than unhealthy sugary sodas and juices. Recent trends show that there has been a decrease in milk consumption in schools (USDA, 2017). This rule will help increase milk consumption which is essential for children since milk is a source of calcium and vitamin D to help bone growth (USDA, 2017).   Lastly, this new rule will help schools compensate for loss of revenue and high cost expenditures. Some schools that participate in the NSLP are considering leaving the program due to a low frequency of low-income children buying school lunch resulting in a significant loss of revenue (Sifferlin, 2013). The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) reimburses $2.93 per eligible student (receiving a free or reduced lunch) to schools that take part in the NSLP, and an additional 6 cents following standard guidelines (Sifferlin, 2013). This poses a problem for small and private schools because they have a very small population of low-income students to partake in the NSLP in order to receive adequate reimbursements from the USDA. Strict dietary guidelines without reimbursement from the USDA impose high costs to feed children healthy meals in small schools (Sifferlin, 2013). If this rule is implemented it could conceivably increase student participation in purchasing school meals which in turn would generate revenue for schools that have suffered monetary hardships. 
 
 Some concerned individuals with opposing views may find that this rule would undo all the progress being made to prevent children from eating unhealthy food while at school. However, we must take into consideration the negative consequences brought upon by these dietary regulations that cause children to skip eating lunch because they do not find the new healthy food appealing or delicious. Furthermore this would cause students to become malnourished since they are skipping breakfast or lunch. Other initiatives must be implemented to help students eat healthy food in school without forcing them to go hungry and compromise their health.    Conclusion  As a conscientious citizen, I believe that the implementation of this ruling would be beneficial to both students and schools. Therefore, I strongly urge the USDA to enact these menu-planning flexibilities for CNPs and schools, to ensure children are receiving meals that are enticing without sacrificing students’ well being and to lessen the monetary burden upon participating programs and schools.

2017,FNS-2017-0021-1084,nan,Constituent,"Executive Summary 
 
My name is Elizabeth and I am a graduate student at the University of Michigan School of Public Health. I am writing to express support of the proposed interim rule (RIN: 0584-AE53) that would allow for flexibility under 3 regulatory requirements. This proposed rule would reduce some of the burdensome constraints School Food Authorities (SFAs) experience in providing meals while maintaining regulations on key drivers of childhood obesity such as caloric content and trans fats.  
 
Background 
 
Participation in the National School Lunch Program (NSLP) and the School Breakfast Program (SBP) reduces food insecurity, improves dietary intake, positively impacts health and obesity rates, and supports a better learning environment.  • During the summer, rates of food insecurity rise when students are unable to obtain meals through the NSLP or the SBP (Lill, n.d.).  • Secondary education students who eat breakfast tend to have a lower body mass index (BMI), where a high BMI can be interpreted as an indicator of obesity (Fiore et al., 2006).  • On average, school lunches offer better nutrition than packed lunches brought from home (Farris et al., 2014). • Studies have found a positive relationship between childhood nutrition and academic achievement (Glewwe et al., 2001). Behavioral, emotional, and academic problems are more common among children experiencing food insecurity (Kleinman et al., 1998). 
 
Constraints on School Food Authorities 
 
The flexibility allowed in the proposed interim rule would help alleviate some of the overwhelming regulatory, operational, and financial constraints School Food Authorities (SFAs) experience in the procurement, preparation, and service of meals.  
 
The 2012 USDA nutritional standards for NSLP and SBP meals make up an 80 page document that details the quantity and frequency of at which micronutrients and macronutrients must be served (Nutritional Standards, 2012). The complexities of these standards, with state and local level variations, make compliance difficult for health professionals, advocates, and SFAs to understand and implement (School Meals, 2014). When combined with the demands of students’ preferences, meeting such constraints are an operational and financial challenge as well.  
 
SFAs have reported operational challenges related to the procurement, preparation, and service of meals as a result of the 2012 Rules. In School Year (SY) 2013-2014, 81% of SFAs reported procuring products to meet standards a challenge (Murdoch et al., 2016). In SY 2013-2014, 93% of SFAs reported that maintaining their budget was a challenge (Murdoch et al., 2016). The federal reimbursements for these programs barely cover the costs of labor, equipment, and overhead, leaving very little funds for the cost of the food itself.  
 
The flexibilities on the fat content of milk, whole-grains, and sodium content, would make compliance to standards less operationally and financially challenging. Given the critical 
importance of the NSLP and SBP in addressing food insecurity, childhood obesity, nutritional intake, and academic performance, this rule should be implemented to reduce the regulatory, operational, and financial constraints imposed on SFAs.  
 
Drivers of Childhood Obesity 
 
The CDC highlights high caloric content and low-nutrient content as characteristics of a diet that can lead to childhood obesity (CDC, 2016). The CDC also cites the federal Dietary Guidelines for Americans to dictate what constitutes a healthful diet, the same guidelines used to regulate NSLP and SBP meals (CDC, 2016). Even under these flexibilities for milk, grains, and sodium, the regulations would continue to comply with almost all the nutrient guidelines under Dietary Guidelines for Americans. Furthermore, NSLP and SBP meals would still provide the appropriate calorie and nutrient content for students.    As stated previously, NSLP and SBP reduce food insecurity, which is associated with increased risk of obesity (Adams et al., 2003). Because high-calorie, low nutrient foods are accessible and inexpensive, food insecure children are more likely to experience obesity (Guthrie et al., 2009). Packed lunches from home were found to be more likely to fall in the high-calorie, low-nutrient category than school lunches (Farris et al., 2014). By removing some obstacles and complexities, more school districts can participate in NSLP and SBP and reduce food insecurity and childhood obesity at faster rates.  
 
Conclusion 
 
Because NSLP and SBP meals are essential to reducing food insecurity, childhood obesity, and improving the academic performance of students, I support the proposed interim rule as it stands because it reduces the burdensome regulatory, operational, and financial constraints on SFAs while maintaining healthful dietary guidelines.

2017,FNS-2017-0021-1090,nan,Constituent,"I whole heartedly agree that these changes should be made.  However, I would encourage you to make the whole grain rich flexibility a standard.  Currently SFA's having to fill out a waiver request to our state agencies in order to provide non whole grain rich products in their schools.  We are required to provide documentation on these items.  Many school districts in our area are receiving rejection letters because they have not provided enough documentation.  This is quite a burden on our school districts to require us to do this, and we will be required to refile every year.  Please consider making it a standard that SFA's can provide 50% of their grains as non-whole grain rich products, without have to petition our state agencies. ",In favor of flexibilies

Rolling back to 50% of grains being whole grain rich is a great way to balance the changes with the students, not everything is good with whole grain, CHICKEN PRODUCTS ARE TERRIBLE  and that's a staple of school lunch. 
PASTA IS ALSO A TURNOFF TO STUDENTS WHOLE GRAIN, LET'S REMEMBER KIDS EAT WITH THERE EYES!
If our food does not have eye appeal, we've lost them before they've even taken a bite. It's only nutrition if they eat it!
1% flavored milk  will bring kids back to drinking milk again.

2017,FNS-2017-0021-1097,nan,Constituent,"As an RD working directly in K-12 Schools I have some suggestions based on my hands on experiences with these guidelines since they've been released:
1. leave the milk as it is... the kids are used to the fat free flavored milk so why change? 
2. Change the whole grain requirement back to what it was when the new guidelines started, at least 50% of products offered need to be whole grain rich;  As an RD, I would counsel someone to make sure at least 1/2 their grains are whole grain, so why put a burden of 100% whole grain on schools?  Some products just are not popular when whole grain, such as pasta, so it would increase the chance of a child eating the meal if it was non-whole grain in this instance (and in some cases these may be the only meals some kids are getting!!).  Get rid of the waiver though and just allow it for all.  The waiver is cumbersome and confusing to keep track of.  Just allow all to do it as 50% or more being whole grain.  Schools who have successfully implemented 100% WG can stay that way if they prefer, but it gives more flexibility to the others that are struggling.
3. Sodium requirements i think are good as they are.  The struggle really with the sodium (and fat and calories) is that you have it based on how many students are planned to take each meal... so one district could be fine with sodium since most kids pick lower sodium options, while other schools may struggle because their kids love the deli sandwiches.  A better approach to the nutritionals in general would be to look at each complete meal that the school plans to serve and give a range that these nutrients needs to be within based on just that meal.  This way you can analyze the nutrients of the  actual meal rather than just an average based on student preference.

2017,FNS-2017-0021-1117,nan,Constituent,"As a registered dietitian nutritionist working in school nutrition, I support this final rule for flexibility with milk, whole grains and sodium requirements. While our primary goal is nourishing students so they are healthy and ready to learn, menu acceptability and student preference must also be considered; especially regarding the sodium limits. When manufacturers decrease sodium content they are forced to substitute with other food additives while decreasing taste, in some cases. A similar case can be made for flavored milk. While the sugar content is added and higher than unflavored, we also recognize that school-aged students do not get sufficient Calcium which puts them at greater risk for bone-related diseases and injuries. Students, families and communities understand the position of USDA but some flexibility is needed so school districts can accomplish their mission of creating healthy, nutritionally-balanced individuals who contribute to this society.

2017,FNS-2017-0021-1237,nan,Constituent,"I believe it would be in the best interest of the child nutrition programs to continue the flexibilities for milk, whole grains, and sodium requirements indefinitely.  All of these nutrition requirements have great intentions, but they don't matter unless the kids are eating the food.
The Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommend fat-free or low-fat milk options.  I think the child nutrition program requirements should line up with that.  Would you rather your child drink 1% chocolate milk or skip the milk altogether?  There are too many important nutrients in milk to worry about a little extra fat and/or sugar.
The Dietary Guidelines also recommend that you make half of your grains whole grain throughout the course of the day.  We have made great strides in getting the kids to accept whole grain breads and buns, but there are still some items (whole grain biscuits and pasta) that the kids do not appreciate.  Also, some of these whole grain products we are serving the kids actually contain more sodium, fat, sugar, and calories than their non-whole grain counterparts because manufacturers are trying to make them more palatable to students.  Is making a biscuit higher in saturated fat and sodium worth it for an additional 1 gram of fiber?  I think not.  Yes, we could make an amazing whole grain biscuit from scratch that I am sure the kids would love and would be better nutritionally, but school cafeterias are constantly short-staffed.  They can't find full-time and part-time employees, let alone substitutes. If you do find someone to work, they are probably lacking basic cooking schools. Extending the whole grain waivers is fine, but I think it makes a lot more sense to eliminate the extra paperwork and red tape and just make the requirement that half of the grains offered over the course of the week must be whole grain-rich.
The sodium targets are probably the biggest challenge with the average school in the United States.  Schools are trying new recipes and manufacturers are reducing the amount of sodium in pre-made products.  Meeting target 1 or target 2 for sodium is not really the issue.  The issue is getting the kids to still eat the meals when those targets are being met.  I walk into schools where salt packets and salt shakers are being brought from home and passed around the high school cafeteria.  We know we should eat less salt.  We know our students should eat less salt.  I also know, however, that saltiness is something your taste buds adapt to.  If you start eating a lower sodium diet, you may eat fast food french fries and gag because they are so salty. If you eat a high salt diet, you may add salt to the same fast food french fries because they aren't salty enough for your taste.  So, in theory our students should adapt to a lower salt diet, right?  Not so fast! We are typically only feeding them 1-2 meals a day, 5 days a week.  If they are going home to eat at restaurants or convenience foods prepared at home that are high in salt, our meals are never going to have enough salt for them.  We are going to continue to have complaints and salt shakers passed around the cafeteria.  Sodium intake is definitely a public health issue.  For the target 2 and target 3 sodium restrictions to ever work widespread in the average school, something must change in the homes of our students.  We can't win them over to lower sodium diets on only 1 meal a day.  I think we need to stick with sodium target 1.",In favor of flexibilies

Maintain Target 1 sodium limits.  There is simply no science-based evidence that lowering sodium below this level will deliver any benefits to healthy children and teens.  Even though my school district is small we have made a commitment to serve as much fresh, scratch-made food to the students as possible.  We employ two professionally trained chefs and have the ability to control the sodium in our recipes to a high degree.  But even with all their skills we cannot lower sodium levels to Target 2 or below without the most severe loss of palatability or even outright impossibility.  The difficulties involved are insurmountable and put districts in the position of having to turn to industrial food products where chemicals, additives, etc. are used to bring products into compliance.  We have already seen this in the Smart Snacks program where Hot Cheetos, frosted toaster pastries and ice cream stay on while chef salads and turkey sandwiches are eliminated.  I jokingly tell people that the Smart Snacks rule ought to be ""If it can be made by a human person in a kitchen you cannot serve it.  If it can be made in a lab, you can.""  Please don't let this happen to meal programs as well.
Waivers for whole-grain foods.  It is very important to allow districts the ability to receive whole-grain waivers for specific items.  Doing so is consistent with the Dietary Guidelines for Americans which do not require 100% whole grains at all times.  Tastes and food cultures vary across America and some 100% whole-grain items are completely unacceptable in some areas (example:  whole-grain grits in the South.)  Some whole-grain items also have a different functionality in the cooking process that cannot be overcome.  In my district we have one central kitchen that cooks for all our locations and we send the food out hot.  The food needs to be able to be kept at a safe temperature for up to three hours.  Whole-grain pasta cannot.  After 90 minutes, the pasta disintegrates into small rice-like pieces.  A recent study by the School Nutrition Association reiterated that over 70% of schools report significant problems with pasta.  Instead of a one-size-fits-all, allowing the flexibility to districts to make a judgement call on a few items that are not acceptable to their students is a prudent solution.

Flexibility for milk, whole grains, and sodium are important aspects of a functional school nutrition program for Local Education Agencies and their nutrition departments.
Milk - 1% (or low fat) flavored milk is sufficiently different from fat free to be discernable to the pallet. The small amount of fat has a minimal impact in dietary intakes but has a significant impact on flavor. Also, given the regulations for grains not proteins in the breakfast meal pattern, some amount of fat intake also helps with satiety and minimizing feelings of hunger. In fact, I would recommend allowing 2% (or reduced fat) plain milk, which would provide an incentive for children to consumer plain milk, given its richer taste and texture.
Whole grains - not everything grain-based food functions or tastes good when whole grain rich. Biscuits, grits, sushi rice, some pastas to name just a few. While at least 50% of grains a student consumes should indeed be whole grain rich, acknowledging that a whole grain rich product can contain 50% enriched grains means USDA is not advocating the banishment of non-whole grains. 
Sodium - current technology, and taste buds, will not allow many food items to reach proposed sodium limits. Whole food groups would disappear from menus, such as cheese, for example. Given the method of introduction, with a hard start date rather than a graduated introduction by grades meant for a very rough start for the HHFKA (Healthy Hungry Free Kids Act). Let the science of sodium confirm the necessity of such stringent limits and let the science of food catch up with the rather draconian limits on sodium.",In favor of flexibilies

I hope that I see more changes in this direction in the future, specifically as it relates to the elimination of any form of sugar and processed grains and carbohydrates. The general public has been mislead long enough and it is about time public organizations started to apply common sense.
In the absence of processed carbohydrates and sugar, I believe that meals with excess sodium will have no effect whatsoever on high blood pressure, nor will they lead to increased risk of developing heart disease at an earlier age. 
Thanks to the influence of large groups such as Monsanto, I believe there is no such thing as a ""healthy grain"" and on top of that, artificially modified grains are refined to a point where all they do in our bodies in spoke insulin. I fully support the removal of all grain and corn products from schools, including grain-based oils which are shown to be highly inflammatory. Whole grains provide absolutely no nutrients (which is why they need to be fortified) since modern farming methods do not embrace sustainable methods and multi purpose use of land. There is more fiber in broccoli than in grains, so lets get more broccoli into our schools. Eating whole grains leads to increased incidents of leaky gut, gluten intolerance, disrupted gut bacteria, autoimmune diseases, inflammation, and ultimately heart disease.

1.	 Option to offer flavored, low-fat milk
2.	Option for State waivers on whole grain-rich items
3.	Retaining Sodium Target 1
I would like to request that the whole grain-rich waivers and maintaining the sodium restriction at Target 1 continue into the 
foreseeable future.  I base this request on student acceptability factors related to comparable food options in the retail 
marketplace.  Students want to see familiar items in their school cafes.  Dining out is a reality for a majority of Americans 
which has exposed our student customers to a larger variety of options of foods that are not whole grain nor low in sodium.  
This difference in palatability has caused them to choose to bring food from home or not to eat in our school cafes.  
Continuing to reduce sodium levels beyond Target 1 will cause our food products to have no taste as compared with food sold
 in the retail marketplace even with the addition of spices.  In addition to student preference, there are issues with the ability of
 whole grain products to retain quality when having to be hot held for service.  Whole grain pasta is a great example of this
 which is a main reason why there are a high number of exemption waivers for this product.  Even when slightly undercooked
 and cooked in batches it can become a sticky mess by the time meal service is complete.  It cannot be reheated and 
therefore causes increased kitchen waste for noodles not selected by students.  While only 15% of programs have asked for
 the whole-grain waiver I feel this is primarily due to concerns about the waiver option being removed.  Directors who have
 made the effort to go 100% whole-grain rich do not want to ""back-off"" and offer a non-whole-grain rich item just to have to go
 back to 100% whole-grain rich when waivers expire in a year.  In my District I waited two years to apply assuming the waiver
 would be gone after a year.   While overall participation in the US has remained stable, programs in areas that are more 
affluent (<55% of students on free/reduced meal benefits) continue to struggle with dropping participation rates especially 
when a majority of their student customers participate at the paid rate.
The interim final rule notes many of my other concerns such as:
 - Available food options have continued to decline as manufacturers are either exiting the school nutrition market or delaying changes due to R&D issues and the short timeline to make changes.  
 - Limited ability to effectively plan menus due to changes/uncertainty of waiver availability.
 - Limited availability of acceptable whole-grain rich alternates to regionally popular items such as grits and biscuits.

2017,FNS-2017-0021-5492,nan,Constituent,"I would like to see a change in the requirement of the students having to take a 1/2 cup fruit or vegetable as well.  This requirement may have had good intentions, but it has resulted in billions of dollars wasted annually with the kids throwing it out.  Any one that tells you 'the kids are taking it' needs to stand by the trash and see what they are throwing out.  The kids are taking it because they HAVE TO, not because they want to.  I like how it was before when we offered the fruits and vegetables and the kids could take what they wanted.  I would say that about 80% of the students at breakfast and lunch throw their fruits/veggies out.  We really try to encourage them to eat some of it, but, let's face, they are going to eat what they are going to eat.  We can force them take take 1 carrot or a plate full of carrots.  If they are only going to eat 1 carrot that is what they are going to eat.  I also feel that by forcing them to take food they don't want we are creating very bad eating habits by teaching them it's OK to throw food out.  In addition, having had a eating disorder when I was younger, I feel it can create negative emotions about food when forcing it on them.  Offering fruits and vegetables is very important, but forcing it on them is not a good thing.

Some of them good, some not so good.  It has been my observation the 100% whole grain has driven away many of our high school students who used to eat lunch with us.  They now go to the local quick shops and ""greasy spoon"" cafes where they purchase deep fried, high sodium, high calorie, high cholesterol foods on a regular basis.  After visiting with many of them I have found that if, in some instances, we served a non-whole grain product they would return to school lunch.  One example is the flour tortilla, they simply do not like like the whole grain tortilla and will not eat at school on tex-mex day, while prior to the whole grain rule they showed up in large numbers.
As far as flavored milk is concerned, it has been my observation that when we do not provide that option milk consumption drops dramatically.
I believe they have adjusted to the current sodium amounts fairly well.  However, if it should drop even more I see it having a very negative effect on our school lunch participation.

2017,FNS-2017-0021-5499,nan,Constituent,"Re: Milk
I have two points regarding Milk;
    1. Flavored milk should not be allowed due to sugar content. Sugar is just as hazardous to health as sodium and also interferes with learning which is the whole reason children are at school. There is 4 tsp of sugar in a milk which adds up to 8 pounds of sugar a school year. This is not necessary. If these children want flavored milk, they can get that at home. 
    2. We need to stay educated on current milk studies which all show that full fat milk is better than low, especially for children. You can not categorize a whole substance as unhealthy simply because of calories. That is not a defining health factor. We should strive to be serving children whole, fresh, natural foods whenever possible. 
Re: Whole Grain Flexibility
      I am in favor of some flexibility to avoid food waste until we have better products to choose from however I believe they need to be subject to approval from the local department of education. There is overwhelming evidence that grains and fiber are essential for healthy bodies. I also feel if a school should be required to off/serve a whole grain everyday. For example, if they can't do whole grain pasta, then whole grain bread sticks should be served with the pasta.  ",In favor of flexibilies

In that time I have seen many changes trying to ""improve"" school lunch including the latest meal pattern. I appreciate the USDA's efforts to address the challenges school districts have confronted in this search for healthier meals for students.
School food service professionals and food vendors have made significant progress in reducing sodium in school menus to meet Target 1 limits. Still, many of us are concerned about the availability of foods that will meet future sodium limits and whether these will be acceptable by students. We have taken many steps to make meals palatable while staying within the Target 1 guide. We are hampered by the tastes of students who are accustomed to foods with higher sodium content as well as higher fat content. Sodium and fat are flavor enhancers, so by reducing them it can make food less palatable in comparison to what they get at home or at a restaurant.  
Naturally occurring sodium present in meat, milk and other low-fat dairy foods will force schools to take nutritious choices off the menu, and drive more students away from healthy school meals.
The USDA should maintain Target 1 sodium levels and eliminate future targets. If that is not feasible, the USDA should consider differentiating between naturally occurring sodium and added sodium.

Regarding Sodium:  The reduction in sodium in our meals provided under the Child Nutrition Program guidelines has resulted in salt shakers coming to the lunchroom from lockers.  Students will leave school to go to local fast food restaurants and complain that the food at school is tasteless, despite the seasoning bars placed for them to utilize.   They are choosing foods soaked in grease.  Staff in our district work diligently to provide food of great quality, not overcooking / heating, and making sure food is moist when it should be.  As we reduce sodium in our food at school, it is compared to food prepared elsewhere that has not had sodium reduced, thus making the school food less appetizing and the reputation of our staff and program decrease, resulting in a decrease in participation.  As I agree that food offered to children should not have an excess of sodium, it does not make a difference to that child if it does not taste good, they will be leaving school in 3 hours to go on to however much sodium will be allowed them in their home or childcare; so they will put that food item in the garbage and it is no big deal to them.  They'll take it, but they won't consume it.
Currently, all of our canned and frozen vegetables go out to the students with no seasonings, and no margarine as we have the next Target level for Sodium hovering over us as operators of a CNP, however, students are provided seasonings to create their own flavor to their liking.  The choices are still low on these vegetable items, and what is taken because of the reimbursable requirement where vegetables are concerned, is often discarded.
I ask that you reduce the requirement of  C. vegetable as a daily offering to  C.  As  vegetables are a wonderful source of vitamins and nutrients, it is a training nightmare to get staff to understand that if a student only has 3 components on his/her tray, and only one is a vegetable (no fruit), that they must take  C. because that is the daily requirement if they are only choosing 3 components.
Where milk is concerned, whatever we can do to put those nutrients into our student's bodies would be fantastic.  Students were very disappointed when we discontinued the low-fat flavored milk.   That is the only milk some of them would drink, and they just quit choosing milk.
I ask that you use the rule that 50% of our grain offerings be Whole Grain.  Industry has done a great job of providing some Whole Grain options for CNP's that are palatable and acceptable to our students, however, there are some options that just don't satisfy our students and they are difficult to work with.  We have discarded much WG Bread Dough because we do not get it to raise evenly and to acceptable standards that we want to put our name behind. 
While I can produce records of decreased purchase of various food items and document that it is because of dissatisfied students, that is just one more record you are asking me to provide, and the regulations already have our department overloaded that it is a struggle to get the daily record keeping done satisfactorily.   
Please adjust these regulations to Target I Sodium Levels, allow Low Fat Flavored Milk, set the Whole Grain Requirement to 50% of our grains offered, and put the Vegetable daily offering requirement at  C.

Allowing low-fat, flavored milk in school meals and snacks programs is one strategy that would result in greater intakes of recommended dairy foods. Science and public health authorities support the role of flavored milk in improving childrens diets. The American Heart Association (AHA) explains that sweetened dairy products have a positive impact on diet quality, because the small of amount of sweetness increases the palatability, enjoyment, and consumption of nutrient-rich food items. Similarly, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) supports flavored milks in schools  as they state, consumed within recommended calorie amounts, sweetness can offer an effective tool to promote consumption of nutrient-dense foods and beverages. A number of scientific studies have also shown that children and adolescents who include flavored milk in their diet are more likely to meet dairy recommendations and nutrient needs for calcium and magnesium.
 
In addition to milk, yogurt  namely strained, naturally high-protein Greek Yogurt and non-Greek yogurt, and drinkable Greek Yogurt varieties  is a good, nutrient-dense dairy form for children.

Milk Flexibilities
The proposed flexibility of the interim final rule that allows low-fat flavored milk
into the program is applauded. This flexibility should increase intake of milk and
help bridge the gap for calcium and Vitamin D intake in children. Flavored milk
consumption was not associated with increased body weight of normal weight 
children, but was associated with improvements in nutrient intake (Fayet-Moore
et al. 2016) in a systematic review.
The current regulation does not permit the serving of flavored low-fat milk due to
the added sugar and calories in these beverages. The 2015-2020 Dietary
Guidelines for Americans (DGA 2015-2020) recommends consumption of fat free
and low-fat dairy product such as milk. The reduced consumption of milk has
also resulted in increased food waste for some school food service programs
(Blondin et al. 2017).
Whole Grains
The Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommends you 'make half your grains
whole grain'. School meals are a great opportunity for school children to
consume whole grains in their diets. Much research has been conducted on
innovative ways to include whole grains in school breakfast and lunch, including
cereals, breads, pizza crusts, whole grain pasta, and whole grain snacks.
Although there are challenges to prepare whole grain products, food
technologists have made great strides in innovating to expand whole grain
options. These options can help improve intake of whole grains, which remains
much below recommended levels.
School food service operators are challenged to procure and serve whole grainrich foods. In recognition of these challenges for both schools and food
manufacturers to procure and develop whole grain-rich options, a short-term
extension of these flexibilities beyond 2018-2019 for certain foods is reasonable.
The interim final rule reported 'Pasta, bread, and tortillas are among the most
common food items for which exemptions have been requested, and other
regionally popular products, such as grits and breakfast biscuits, are also
reported.' Because these foods are cited as the greatest challenges with the
whole grain-rich requirement it is appropriate to limit flexibilities to these foods as
part of the short-term extension. This is also a recognition that some foods, such
as pasta, are more challenging to make with whole grains than refined grain.
However, many whole grain-rich foods are readily available and acceptable to
children, including ready-to-eat whole grain cereals, snack bars, pizza crusts,
and oatmeal cookies.
The flexibilities on certain foods could be extended until the end of 2021, to
coincide with the end of USDA's proposed Sodium Target 1. This extension
provides schools time to address product issues, including recipes and sourcing,
of whole grain-rich foods in their menus. Food manufacturers are also
incentivized to invest in the development and manufacturing of whole grain-rich
foods that meet the requirements by this deadline. This approach will help
maintain gains made in offering whole grain-rich foods while allowing flexibility for
the most challenging whole grain products to procure or prepare. 
Sodium
The extension of Sodium Target 1 is important for both practical implementation
as well as the uncertainty surrounding the current Dietary Reference Intakes
(DRI) for sodium.
There was insufficient evidence to establish an Estimated Average Requirement
(EAR) and Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) for sodium, but an Adequate
Intake (AI) and Upper Level (UL) were set. The UL for sodium of 2,300 mg/day
was based largely on evidence showing a positive relationship bef\..veen sodium
intake and blood pressure.
Since that time, IOM undertook a review of the evidence and released a report
""Sodium Intake in Populations: Assessment of Evidence"" (""The 2013 NAS
Report""). This report concluded that the studies on health outcomes are
inconsistent in quality and insufficient in quantity to determine that sodium
intal<es <2300 mg per day either increase or decrease the risk of heart disease,
stroke, or all-cause mortality.
A DRI update for sodium and potassium is expected in the future that will help
set long term targets for sodium in school lunch. It is well known that sodium
intakes are associated with calorie intakes so having a one size fits all approach
to sodium is impractical and not supported by science.
Salt plays important functional, food safety, stability and flavor roles in foods.
Salt has historically been associated with food safety and preservation in canned
goods, processed and dried meats, and cheeses; these functions continue to be
important today. In baked goods sodium is a component of leavening agents,
aids in dough conditioning, helps control water activity and provides flavor.
The challenge of reducing sodium across the food supply to achieve FDA's draft
long term targets is overwhelming. It has also proven to be difficult for school
food operators. Since the scientific support for the current ORis for sodium is
evolving, I support flexibility in sodium targets for school lunch.
Thank you for the opportunity to provide these comments. School feeding
programs are a critical part of childhood nutrition in the United States and we
should allow more local control to provide meals that are culturally sensitive and
provide optimum nutrition. Although this will always be challenging, I applaud
your agency for working toward the middle ground of defending nutrition while

2017,FNS-2017-0021-7319,nan,Constituent,"I support the flexibility in CNP for allowing 1% flavored milk, allowing State agencies to grant whole grain waivers and to retain Sodium Target 1 levels fro the National School Lunch and School Breakfast Programs.  Further, these allowances should become permanent in the final rule.
The positive changes in the meal pattern from the Healthy Hunger-Free Kids Act (HHFKA) have not been well received by our student customers, as evidenced by the decrease in participation in these programs and the increase in plate waste.  Allowing 1% flavored milk will improve the flavor profile of this crucial, nutrient packed meal component that is needed to build strong bones in this population.  As the HHFKA requires the availability of water at meals, students are opting to drink water with their meals in place of milk.  We need to convince them to choose to drink milk,and improving the flavor will have a positive impact in this direction.
Not all whole grain (wg) foods are accepted by students, i.e. biscuits and pasta.  Other items such as wg cereals, breads and buns have gained acceptance as the manufacturers have improved their formulations.  Most schools are serving 75% or greater grains as whole grain, with the exceptions being few and far between.  The final rule should reflect current practices and establish a new baseline that is greater than 50%, yet, allowing some flexibility for items that just are not good in a whole grain format.
The sodium targets initially rolled out in HHFKA for target level 3 are unreasonable, unattainable and too restrictive.  Does anyone realize that the target 3 levels emulate a low sodium meal served in institutional settings, such as hospitals?  Do we want our schools to serve food even slightly resembling a hospital diet intend for those with critical illnesses?  
Schools have greatly decreased the sodium present in foods. No salt or margarine is added to cooked vegetables (probably why the students don't eat them well....),  and recipes have been adjusted to reduce the amounts of salt added.  However, many foods commonly used in recipes and required as meal components, are not under the control of the menu planner and contain sodium in amounts that are all contributing to the per meal calculation.  Examples include: milk, unflavored, 120 mg of sodium naturally present, 1 oz. wg cereal 110-220 mg, bread or buns  200-300 mg of sodium; a 2 oz. biscuit 300- 500 mg, 1 oz. cheese 400 mg, 2 tablespoons salad dressing 225-300 mg., 1/2 c. tater tots from sweet potatoes 230 mg, etc.  Please add theses up to see how difficult it is to comply with the targeted sodium level 2 and virtually impossible for target level 3.  This is the reality of our food supply chain.  Many school can not obtain whole grain hot dog buns, as their local bread supplier cannot make a run that small and it is not economically feasible, as there is no retail demand for wg hot dogs buns. 
Please leave the sodium targets at level 1 in the final rule.

2017,FNS-2017-0021-7326,nan,Advocacy,"The Grocery Manufacturers Associationi
(GMA) respectfully provides the following comments related to
the Interim Final Rule in the above-referenced Federal Register notice.
I. Introduction
GMA is firmly committed to helping consumers maintain healthful dietary practices and providing
consumers with food and beverage products to meet a diverse range of needs, interests, and values.
GMA supports the actions of the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) to provide flexibilities in the
Child Nutrition Programs relating to milk, whole grains and sodium requirements. GMA agrees that
ample lead time and certainty of regulatory requirements are needed both by the school food
authorities (SFA) and the food and beverage industry to ensure that children are being provided meals
that meet the nutrition standards. GMA encourages USDA to meet its proposed deadline of publishing
the final rule by Fall of 2018 in order to ensure successful implementation of the updated regulations in
School Year (SY) 2019-2020.II. Milk Flexibilities
GMA is supportive of the milk flexibility provided in the interim final rule. The 2015-2020 Dietary
Guidelines for Americans recommends the consumption of fat free and low-fat dairy product such as
milk.1
 Consumption of milk, a key source of calcium and vitamin D which are necessary for optimal bone
health in children and adolescents2
, has been shown to be declining.
3
 The reduced consumption of milk
has also resulted in increased food waste for some school food service programs.4
The current regulation, which does not permit the service of flavored low-fat milk, was in part due to the
added sugar and calories contributions of these beverages. Flavored milks have in recent years been
reformulated to deliver less added sugar and total calories. A recent literature review found that
flavored milk consumption was not associated with increased body weight of normal weight children,
but was associated with higher milk intake5
. The proposed milk flexibility could support not only an
increase in milk consumption for children but also a reduction in food waste.
III. Whole Grain Flexibilities
The 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans recognizes the benefits associated with whole grain
consumption and recommends ‘making one-half your grains whole’1
. School meals may be one or two
of the only opportunities that school children have to consume whole grains in their diets. GMA
supports the whole-grain rich requirement of the National School Lunch and School Breakfast Programs
as a means of increasing children’s consumption of whole grains. However, as the interim final rule
recognizes, SFAs and food manufacturers face significant challenges in procuring, preparing and
developing whole grain-rich options. Based on this, GMA supports a short-term extension of the whole
grain exemptions for those SFAs that demonstrate hardship in procuring or preparing specific products
that meet the whole grain rich criteria and are acceptable to students. Extending the whole grain-rich
flexibilities until the end of SY 2020-2021 to coincide with the end of USDA’s proposed Sodium Target 1 is reasonable extension. This would provide schools time to continue to address the procurement and
preparation challenges of including these whole grain-rich foods into their menus. Food manufacturers
are also incentivized to invest in whole grain-rich foods that meet the requirements by this deadline.
IV. Sodium Flexibilities
GMA supports the retention of Sodium Target 1 in SY 2018-2019 and continuing the retention through
SY 2020-2021. This extension of Sodium Target 1 is important for practical implementation reasons, as
well as, the uncertainty surrounding the current Dietary Reference Intakes (DRI) for sodium. A
reevaluation and update of the DRI encompassing new information is currently underway by the
National Academies of Science, Engineering and Medicine and is expected to be completed in
2019. GMA supports the re-evaluation of Sodium Targets 2 and 3 based upon any new DRIs.
V. Conclusion
GMA appreciates the opportunity to provide comment on this important issue. We look forward to
working with the USDA and SFAs to meet the nutritional needs of children participating in the Child
Nutrition Programs.

As you have seen the number of meals that have shrunk in the CNP programs have shown that we have gone to far to fast in trying to change the diets of every child. When you see Free and reduced kids nit eating in the cafeteria because the taste has changed to a point they do not enjoy the meals you know the rules are to strong. Sodium changes to the next step is going to make it worse. Why do you think that kids needs to be eating sodium levels where cardiac patients are assigned in the hospital.
Whole grain changes the look as well as the taste and you do not see any of these changes in mainstream restaurants nor the isles in the super market.
Cafeteria cannot be used as learning labs if children don't eat and that is what is happening. Look at the rates of participation. The steps that have been taken are not working. This is one time you need to look at the facts and not the cheer leaders.

I do not believe that the increase in the genetically modified wheat products we are serving our children is a healthy choice. There are studies that show the amount of sugar that these wheat products contain.    Also, there are studies that show the increase in inflammation and gastrointestinal issues accompanied with the consumption of grains.
If the overall guidelines change, that could lead to a healthier lifestyle for many children and also adults.
This is a step in the right direction and I look forward to seeing these changes!

2017,FNS-2017-0021-7425,nan,Advocacy,"Our State Agency is writing to recommend greater flexibility as USDA works to develop a final school meal rule effective in 2019-20.
School food service directors have worked to increase the acceptance of whole grain-rich (WG-R) foods with their students. However, districts continue to report challenges with the current law that all grains offered must be WG-R at breakfast and lunch. While a waiver may be available, it's just one more thing for schools to request, complete and return and for state agencies to review, approve and monitor. 
Student acceptance and product availability seem to be the biggest hurdles we see with some schools reporting a reduction in student participation. It has also been difficult for some schools to obtain the documentation they need to demonstrate WG-R compliance whether it's a CN label or product formulation statement. In reviewing some product formulation statements, we've questioned whether companies even calculate the number of grain servings correctly. Even when a school is granted a waiver, food service must work to win back the students they've lost because they think the same grain products they didn't care for are still being served. In addition, it's not right when a school that is too small to purchase from a vendor, has to order their grain items from the local grocery store and pay a higher price because these are considered special order items. 
All grain items offered in a meal should not have to be WG-R. Most people do not plan their meals to incorporate WG-R items only so why is USDA asking schools to implement a regulation that has proven to be a burden to implement. Therefore, our recommendation is for USDA to go back to the original regulation when it was introduced in 2012 and require that half the grains offered over the course of a week be WG-R. 
The interim rule maintains Target 1 sodium limits in school meals. Food service directors have worked to reduce sodium in their menus by modifying recipes, comparing Nutrition Facts labels when selecting products, limiting condiment usage, increasing the amount of scratch cooking they do and really focusing on converting their salad bars into fruit/vegetable bars. 
We all know that food needs to taste good! You can have the most nutritious items on the menu but if it doesn't have any flavor, then the students aren't going to eat it and again you're faced with a reduction in participation and increased plate waste. USDA must also consider the milligrams of naturally occurring sodium in products like milk. In addition, while students may use self-serve condiments, some of what they take is always left on their tray yet total quantity taken is what is used in a nutrient analysis. The quantity they take versus the quantity they consume can be very different. Condiment usage in a meal is really difficult to measure. We recommend that USDA maintain the Target 1 sodium levels and eliminate future targets. 
The interim rule allows schools to offer 1% flavored milk. Skim flavored varieties of milk have been well received in our state. Food service directors would rather spend the extra fat grams found in 1% flavored milk on other menu items being offered that day.
These comments have been reviewed and approved by the Administrators and Program Specialists (10 individuals) who work with the School Nutrition Programs in our State Agency.

The positive changes in the meal pattern have not been well received by our students. There are more kids not eating because they do not like the whole grain. The kids does like the whole grain biscuits or pasta. They are not crazy about the cereals. 
I think the sodium targets should stay the same. It should not go to target 3 because they will be more kids not eating at school. They already say the food need some salt.
I am afraid if they make more changes the kids are going to stop eating at school. They need to realize that sometimes the food students  eat at school is the only meal they might be getting so we don't need to make it taste like hospital food. We want the kids to eat. ",In favor of flexibilies

I support allowing State Agencies to grant whole grain waivers or to pull back the requirement to 50%.
I support retaining the Target 1 sodium levels or pushing back to standard more consistent with market availability and customer paliteability.
I support revising the required vegetable sub groups so the red orange requirement  is 1/2 cup. 
I support the elimination of the one cup fruit offering (K-8) at breakfast or and/or the elimination of the 1/2 cup fruit requirement.  
I support some type of relaxed standards for Snack Sales or a State Mandate Requiring States to cover reasonable amounts of state employee benefit expenses, to prevent the current decrease in program offerings which is resulting in the undermining of the federal purpose and mandate of child feeding programs.
I support a MANDATE that only ONE regulatory Agency oversee School Food Authorities in the operation of federally funded child feeding programs. Overlapping oversight is slowing the expansion of At Risk After School Supper and preventing the implementation of critical programming.
I support a swift and critical revision of Summer Feeding regulations to allow for NEEDED equity in feeding of children in rural areas where children cannot possibly walk to receive a meal and there is no accessible daily programming where meals can be served.
Generally Speaking:
The changes in the meal pattern mandated by the Healthy Hunger-Free Kids Act (HHFKA) have resulted in nation wide financial losses, and decrease in participation that will take decades to recover from.  
Vegetable sub group requirements and breakfast fruit requirements continue to generate unnecessary and shameful  amounts of food waste while providing insufficient funds to pay for these required items.
The HHFKA requirements put child feeding programs on par with low sodium hospital diets.
Where is the proof this is medically necessary. 
Where is the proof that following even a well respected body of medical professionals is ALL that is needed to implement a multi layered program, particularly one that operates on a razor thin financial margin.
Where is the proof that Mandatory, requirements for putting food on trays will create positive CHANGE eating habits.
Was there consideration for the fact that NONE of these requirements were successfully implemented in the restaurant or grocery industry thus widening the gap between the flavor profiles and acceptability of our programs and almost every where else our students eat?
How about allowing program funds to OFFER new exciting fruit and vegetable choices rather than mandate them.
How about a combination of Culinary Training and Recipe development. 
Where is the justification of maintaining a program that in its implementation actually takes food off the plates of needy children, serves them food they will not eat and sends them home hungry.
Where is the justification for strictly limiting the calories for children who don't have adequate healthy calories at home.
In my opinion many of the supposed research projects, studies and examples of the purported easy and well received implementation of HHFKA are vastly overstated.  Reports of financial success and positive reception are vastly overstated, particularly when considered across a representative cross section of programs nationwide.  Nationwide financial losses and decreased participation numbers must not be ignored.  Nationwide negative press that has denigrated school nutrition programs rather than touting positive change has been devastating to program image, finances and staff moral.
I have decades of experience, committee service, program awards etc.,  I have never seen my peers more exasperated and demoralized than under HHFKA.  Much of the ideals of this legislation are just that Ideals, neither realistic nor achievable.
We all wholeheartedly support dietary analysis and reasonable dietary requirements but dietary considerations alone cannot lead effective change for our programs.
HHFKA's breakfast fruit requirement has damaged expansion of school breakfast particularly in alternative settings and caused averaged sized districts to cut back programming which hurts hungry children particularly in rural America. 
HHFKA's , CEP program provides inadequate financial funding to achieve Free meals for all.  
Smart Snacks rules have caused a decrease in middle and high school lunch sales because students would rather wait until after school and get more of what they really want which is readily available to them.
We are in a state of brokenness please revive this worthy and much needed program.

Further, these allowances should become permanent in the final rule.
The positive changes in the meal pattern from the Healthy Hunger-Free Kids Act (HHFKA) have not been well received by our student customers, as evidenced by the decrease in participation in these programs and the increase in plate waste. Allowing 1% flavored milk will improve the flavor profile of this crucial, nutrient packed meal component that is needed to build strong bones in this population. As the HHFKA requires the availability of water at meals, students are opting to drink water with their meals in place of milk. We need to convince them to choose to drink milk, and improving the flavor will have a positive impact in this direction.
Not all whole grain (wg) foods are accepted by students, i.e. biscuits and pasta. Other items such as wg cereals, breads and buns have gained acceptance as the manufacturers have improved their formulations. Most schools are serving 75% or greater grains as whole grain, with the exceptions being few and far between. The final rule should reflect current practices and establish a new baseline that is greater than 50%, yet, allowing some flexibility for items that just are not good in a whole grain format.
The sodium targets initially rolled out in HHFKA for target level 3 are unreasonable, unattainable and too restrictive. Does anyone realize that the target 3 levels emulate a low sodium meal served in institutional settings, such as hospitals? Do we want our schools to serve food even slightly resembling a hospital diet intend for those with critical illnesses? 
Schools have greatly decreased the sodium present in foods. No salt or margarine is added to cooked vegetables (probably why the students don't eat them well....), and recipes have been adjusted to reduce the amounts of salt added. However, many foods commonly used in recipes and required as meal components, are not under the control of the menu planner and contain sodium in amounts that are all contributing to the per meal calculation. Examples include: milk, unflavored, 120 mg of sodium naturally present, 1 oz. wg cereal 110-220 mg, bread or buns 200-300 mg of sodium; a 2 oz. biscuit 300- 500 mg, 1 oz. cheese 400 mg, 2 tablespoons salad dressing 225-300 mg., 1/2 c. tater tots from sweet potatoes 230 mg, etc. Please add theses up to see how difficult it is to comply with the targeted sodium level 2 and virtually impossible for target level 3. This is the reality of our food supply chain. Many school cannot obtain whole grain hot dog buns, as their local bread supplier cannot make a run that small and it is not economically feasible, as there is no retail demand for wg hot dogs buns. 
Please leave the sodium targets at level 1 in the final rule.

I highly doubt a whole grain biscuit will ever be acceptable by a student. We also want kids drinking milk, because we all know kids need the calcium, etc for good bone health. This is common sense. Now, kids are opting out of choosing milk because they do not like the Fat free flavored milk and choosing water. Water is great, but we need to promote milk for its nutrient benefits.
The HHFKA changes have not been acceptable. I have been a Director of Child Nutrition for the past 7 years and have seen participation in my program decrease tremendously, struggling to get kids to eat in our cafeteria. 
The sodium levels are very unreasonable. I worked as a Dietitian in a clinical setting for 5 years.

2017,FNS-2017-0021-7489,nan,Constituent,"Introduction
It is important that USDA’s School Meal Programs continue to provide our nation’s children with healthy
meals that help them meet Dietary Guidelines recommendations. I submit the following comments for
USDA’s consideration regarding milk, sodium targets, and whole grain food flexibilities. I am a
Distinguished Professor of Nutrition Science at Purdue University and a member of the National
Academy of Medicine. I have studied nutrition requirements in adolescents for almost 30 years with
particular emphasis on bone and cardiovascular health.
Milk
I support the interim final rule that allows the schools the option to serve flavored, low-fat milk
in the 2018–2019 school year. Including this flexibility will undoubtedly encourage consumption
of fluid milk by school children. Milk consumption in schools has been in decline and is widely
reported and recognized (USDA ERS 2017). The decline coincided with 2012 regulations that
prohibited low-fat flavored milk in school meals. Up to that point, low-fat (1%) milk had been
the most widely purchased variety of milk by schools. Strategies that increase intake of nutrient
dense foods, like milk, and reduce potential food waste are encouraged.
The 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans (DGA 2015-2020) recommends the
consumption of fat free and low-fat dairy products. Consumption of milk, a key source of
calcium, vitamin D, and other nutrients in the diet, is vital for optimal bone health in children
and adolescents (Golden et al. 2014). The current regulation which does not permit the serving
of flavored low-fat milk was, in part, the result of added sugar and caloric contributions of these
beverages. However, the minor increase in energy that may result of these flexibilities can
easily be balanced by appropriate school meal planning in order to provide the nutrients milk
provides. Sodium
I agree with the interim final rule that retains Sodium Target 1 through School Year 2018-2019
and continuing the retention of Target 1 through School Year 2020-2021. Extension of Sodium
Target 1 is important for both practical implementation by schools as well as the uncertainty
surrounding the current Dietary Reference Intakes (DRI) for sodium. The National Academies of
Science, Engineering and Medicine is re-evaluating and will update the DRI for sodium. As a
result, it is logical for the USDA to wait for the review to be concluded and base their targets,
and any necessary changes, on the latest science. Issuing final long- term targets before the
review is complete and DRI is updated would be premature.
Whole grain
I recommend that USDA restore the requirement that all grain-based foods be whole grain-rich
while recognizing that continuation of the current flexibilities may be necessary in the near-term
for solutions to be developed that address current challenges faced by schools.
The Dietary Guidelines (2015-2020) recommend that one-half of grains consumed should be
whole grains in recognition of the health benefits associated with whole grain consumption.
Furthermore, the Dietary Guidelines 2015-2020 provide data showing that whole grain intake by
school-aged children is nowhere near one-half of the total grains consumed. Intakes of refined
grains, on the other hand, is several-fold greater than whole grain. School meals are an
important source of nutrition to many children and may in fact be one or two of the only
opportunities to consume whole grains in their diets. As a result, USDA restoring the
requirement for all grain-based foods to be whole grain-rich is a step forward in helping children
achieve recommended intakes of fiber and other nutrients associated with whole grains.
The Interim Final Rule describes challenges expressed by school operators in sourcing and
serving whole grain-rich options that are equally acceptable to students. Examples of grain
foods that are challenging for schools cited included “pasta, bread, and tortillas among the most
common food items for which exemptions have been requested, and other regionally popular
products, such as grits and breakfast biscuits”. As such, flexibilities in the whole grain-rich
requirement could be extended to those foods. Many whole grain-rich foods are readily
available and readily-accepted by children, including ready-to-eat whole grain cereals and snack
bars. Therefore, a period of three years is reasonable for schools and the food industry to find
solutions that include whole grain-rich options.

2017,FNS-2017-0021-7508,nan,Advocacy,"We, the undersigned trade associations, want to thank you for your strong leadership on school 
meals, specifically the release of the interim final rule last week.  As background, together we 
comprise an informal coalition formed on the basis of ensuring science leads policy decisions 
when it comes to the topic of sodium. We strongly support the decision to continue the 
implementation of target 1 sodium standards.
It is vitally important for scientific consensus to be the basis for our US policies, especially 
regarding vulnerable populations such as school-aged children. The most recent dietary 
reference intake (DRI) for sodium was set in 2005 at 2,300mg and the data was extrapolated 
from adult adequate intakes to estimate for children; but a robust amount of emerging data
over the last few years calls this number into question. We believe that regulations on sodium, 
such as the sodium targets set for the school meals programs, should be informed by the most 
recent, relevant, and accurate scientific research and analyses available. To this point, we 
support an update to the sodium and potassium DRI and are pleased to see that one is about to 
commence. In fact, the first meeting of the National Academies committee to do this work is 
set for this week. 
The DRI is of utmost importance as it will set the stage for all federal and state level nutrition 
policies.  Maintaining the target 1 sodium reduction in school meals through school year 2018-
2019 aligns with having science lead policy and we applaud USDA for making this common 
sense decision. Thank you again for your interest, dedication and continued leadership on 
behalf of the health and well-being of our nation’s school children.",In favor of flexibilies

For the whole grain rich flexibility, we would like the final rule to restore the initial requirement that at least half of grains offered through school lunch and breakfast programs be whole grain rich. Exemptions are confusing and administratively burdensome; and a waiver would not allow schools to easily comply with the rule. Schools would still need to work toward 100% WGR on any non-exempt grain product. Under the current requirement to have 100% whole grain rich products, students are eating more whole grain items. However, schools are still struggling with limited availability of specialty whole grain items, as well as meeting students' regional and cultural preferences for certain refined grains. Just as families do, schools should be permitted to serve items like white rice, pasta, grits, bagels, or tortillas on occasion. It is for that reason the OPI believes it is important to focus on helping schools be successful in meeting the requirement rather than promoting exemptions.

First, allowing a choice of flavored low-fat milk opposed to plain milk might increase the chance of the student consuming the low-fat milk. If there are options of different flavors, then this healthier choice is more likely to become a habit. Second, allowing the menus to be whole-grain rich offers the student exposure to this healthier alternative of whole grain they might not otherwise get at home. This could lead to a desire to incorporate this into their diet when they become an adult. Finally, gradually reducing sodium is a much better plan than eliminating the given amount all at once. Let&#39;s face it, salt flavors food and to have it taken away all at once will cause students to not want to eat the meal as much as slowly improving the sodium level while maintaining the flavors.

I have Directed a K-12 and a High School District nutrition program, of which both struggled to meet the 2012 mandate that all grains must be whole grain rich due to regional and cultural preferences for a few specific items like white rice, tortillas or pasta.  Many students stopped eating at school once the menus did not reflect their cultural preferences, which then caused more stigma and negativity toward the program further discouraging needy students to participate.

I also believe that the additives they add to non fat chocolate milk to make it palatable are not a good thing.  Milk fat is essential for growth in children and, again, it doesn&#39;t help to offer non fat milk if the students do not like it and won&#39;t drink it.  It would be better to have them choose the 1% chocolate milk than no milk.  As for the sodium, until manufacturers find a way to make the CN food items taste good with less sodium, it doesn&#39;t make sense to move the sodium target.

In my experience children in our free and reduced classes have two parents that must work, these parents may also not be able to afford child care in the summer.  This situation makes for some very hungry children at home all summer.  What we tend to see however, is that these kids have also been instructed by mom and dad to not go to the door or answer any phone calls so as to not bring attention to the fact that they are at home alone.  On many occasions we may be out in the parking lot with food that they cannot access, given the service constraints of seamless summer.  <br/><br/>- I believe that i may have some thoughts as to how to combat this issue.  We saw great success with the COVID-19 feeding due in large to the flexibility, we were able to feed for multiple days at once and had the ability to serve the adults instead of the children. If the parents are working all week in a normal summer setting it would make more sense to distribute on the weekend and if that was also possible we could serve for the whole week ensuring that while those children are at home during the summer alone, they would have a fridge full of food to eat all week.  I am also realistic in the fact that this is a perfect ideal case and may not always look like this if all the food gets eaten at once or if mom and dad also help eat.

Let&#39;s first establish that these flexibilities allow program operators to make the choice that best fits their district. It does not ban another district from sticking to stricter requirements. These flexibilities do not take away fruit and vegetable requirements and actually move the school nutrition guidelines closer to mirroring the Dietary Guidelines for Americans. I am fully supportive of moving to a half whole grain rich requirement as it will allow for a wider variety of grains to be served. Again, this flexibility gets closer to mirroring the DGAs, though I would prefer to see the requirement be half of grains served must be 100% whole grain and the other half do not need to be (if we are being honest are whole grain ""rich"" [51% whole grain] options really better than their fully refined counterparts? When you compare nutrition labels the difference is minuscule). There is no reason for all flavored milk served to be skim. The fat in milk helps absorption of fat soluble vitamins and slows digestion/promotes satiety. I would rather have flavored 1% milk than flavored skim on my menu. I also support sodium flexibilities as target 3 requirements would be very difficult to realistically reach. For those that have grave concerns about the rollback of the 2012 requirements, I recommend working with your individual school district&#39;s school nutrition program. Lobby to have other options on your menu. The USDA doesn&#39;t require pizza to be served every day. Have a conversation with your district&#39;s school nutrition director about changes you&#39;d like to see to their menu.

Fat free vs 1% milk - there is only 20 calories and 2.5 grams of fat difference and the 1% is more flavorful!  Whole grains - students do not like certain whole grain foods, like tortillas, biscuits, and pasta.  It has a very different taste and texture than the enriched products they&#39;re most likely used to at home.  By offering 50% whole grain rich, we introduce them to whole wheat rolls, buns, and other items that are more similar to their enriched counterparts, while keeping the enriched tortillas, pasta, and biscuits that are very hard to get students to accept.  Sodium - By keeping target 1 sodium restrictions until 2023-2024, this gives menu planners more time to gradually introduce more scratch cooking that is far less sodium than the processed food most cafeterias are serving presently.  It is harder to get students to eat the scratch-made food than processed, which is similar to what they order at fast food restaurants that they like so much.  Our district does at least 50% scratch or fast scratch entrees and the Target 2 sodium restrictions would make us limit our menu even further.

Some items do not lend themselves well to the type of service we have to offer when serving a large amount of students in a short period of time. Pasta is one of these items, it does not turn to a gummy mush when sitting in a steam pan ready to serve hundreds of students. The students have shown a large increase in likeability of our pasta dishes once we switched to enriched pasta. Secondly, we have switched to an enriched biscuit. We have heard many comments from students stating that is the most delicious biscuit they have ever eaten. Not only is the enriched biscuit delicious, it contains a small amount more sodium than the one we used previously, but the taste is significantly better. That leads me to my next concern, which is the sodium level restrictions. I am worried not only will we have difficulties procuring products that will meet our sodium restrictions, we will have increased quality issues and decreased student likeability.

When they have to develop new products to meet the standards it often results in price increases as well.<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span><br/><br/>When it comes to milk, please also consider that sodium, calories, and fat found naturally in milk must be factored into our menu planning and we are required to offer milk.  I believe that we should have the flexibility to offer other varieties if the calories will fit into our planned menu but we should not have to include the naturally according sodium in milk when we perform our analysis. <br/><br/>The flexibilities have allowed us to offer a wider variety of enticing foods, improve our participation, and increased our staff morale.

Even with the flexibilities we still struggle with participation. Our Food Service Management Co. does a great job using spices to add flavor, but for some it just isn&#39;t a salt substitute. I agree that we use too much salt in everyday life so I understand we need to limit it to a certain degree. 100% whole grain in some products such as pasta and biscuits makes for a less than desirable entre. Using 50% whole grain has gained back some participation, but we would like to see more. We have many students who do not like white milk, but will drink flavored milk.

I am responding to the codifying of three planning flexibilities in the Child Nutrition Program. <br/><br/>Sodium flexibility: The target we are ultimately set to achieve regarding sodium is less than a ""low sodium"" diet set by the FDA. Their recommended low sodium diet is <br/>2,000-3,000 mg per day. Our targets are significantly lower. I believe with those targets the food becomes bland and less tasteful to our &#39;customers&#39;. They will forgo the a nutritious meal because of the lack of taste appeal. In my district we had taken our sodium levels down to begin with, when we modified recipes. This was before the Federal Government&#39;s  dietary requirements were implemented. It is in our menu planning that we adjust not only to become healthier but still have our food tasteful and appealing to our &#39;customers&#39; (students). In all honestly foods are laden with sodium but one can rectify that with fresh and frozen vegetables vs canned as an example. I believe School Food Service entities always strive to be healthier. I know we do! I would just ask that you re-look at the limits you have set forth and allow us more time if indeed you want to take the limits lower than  a prescribed &#39;low sodium diet&#39;. I also would ask you to look at our customer base and investigate the loss of that base if food is &#39;drab&#39;.<br/><br/>Milk flexibility: I would ask you continue to allow low-fat flavored milk as part of the reimbursable meal pattern. Personally, I&#39;d rather have a customer drink a flavored milk vs no milk at all because they do not care for unflavored dairy.<br/><br/>Whole Grains flexibility: It would be fantastic if you would allow WG requirements to 50%.

The majority of our students select a flavored milk. If the requirement was upheld, we could ensure American students are receiving just a little bit less fat in their daily diets and help create a habit of fat-free dairy in their future eating.<br/>Our district would support the modification to allow for half of the weekly grains to be whole grain-rich. During the adjustment to the HHFKA, our students did not enjoy many of our traditional products such as tortillas, pasta, breading on items such as chicken products; however, our students widely accepted some other whole-grain rich products such as pizzas, hoagie or hamburger buns, and many breakfast items. Our diet is all about balance. Our program has found a balance where about 75% of our grains are whole grain-rich. Lets give operators some flexibility to allow a few items a week to not meet whole grain-rich requirements to encourage student acceptance and participation in our meals. <br/>Menu planning is a very time consuming part of the School Nutrition Professionals job.

All school nutrition professionals I have worked with have the same goal, to provide healthy, quality meals that kids want to eat. Supporting the 50% whole grain rule, and target 2 sodium restrictions does not mean we support children being unhealthy. We feel these flexibilities are necessary for both the healthy and quality goals. They allow program operators to make the choices that best fit their district. We all have unique challenges in procurement capabilities and cultural preferences, depending on our location throughout the country, rural or urban. A one size fits all approach does not work. When my district went from 100% whole grain items to 75% (changing only pastas, and a couple other bread items that were very poorly accepted), our participation drastically improved those days. The kids still got a variety of fruits and vegetables, their sodium was reasonable (target 2), and were provide a healthy balanced meal, that tasted good. When certain foods are served, fewer kids brought their lunch from home, which are typically less healthy than what they could have received at school. If the goal is to improve student health and learning, we want them to eat meals at school, which will happen more if they enjoy the food. The Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommend 50% or more of grains being whole. Even taking advantage of the flexibilities offered in this proposal, schools are still meeting and exceeding this. The 3rd sodium restriction is not realistic, nor necessary based on needs of children. It is more restrictive than what a heart failure patient might be prescribed. Its very unrealistic to properly implement, and will again cause decreased participation in our programs because the food will lack flavor. Please keep in mind, these flexibilities do not ban districts from implementing stricter requirements. These flexibilities do not take away fruit and vegetable requirements, and still encourage whole grains and lower sodium. They simply offer districts who struggle to procure whole grain or low sodium items some flexibility to best provide variety and quality meals for their students. More importantly, more children will eat school meals, versus bringing there typically less healthy meals from home.  Thank you for your consideration. ",In favor of flexibilies

I have a bachelor&#39;s degree in nutrition, and I&#39;m currently completing my internship to become a registered dietitian. I&#39;ve had several years of nutrition-related coursework recently and am a member of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, who advocates for childhood nutrition as well as the National School Lunch Program (NSLP) and School Breakfast Program (SBP).<br/><br/>I spent several months of my internship with a school district in Utah where I saw first-hand the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on school foodservice departments. Budget readjustments, food and supply shortages as well as staffing emergencies were common. Planning school menus is already a time-consuming process for nutrition and foodservice directors with the extensive nutrient analysis processes required. It is an extra challenge to create menus that young children will eat that are also healthy enough and in accordance with federal guidelines. Now with the pandemic, the amount of work and coordination responsibilities on foodservice departments is higher than ever. I would like to express my support for allowing more time to implement Sodium Target 2 until SY 2024-2025, as well as eliminating the Final Target for sodium reduction. School districts have had enough to deal with recently and will need several years to continue reconstructing normalcy in the way school meals are served. In addition, food production companies may prefer the extra time to develop new products that will stay up to date with ever-changing school sodium guidelines. <br/><br/>Of course, it is my great concern that children receive the best nutrition from our schools. The new ""final"" goal, Target 2, to be implemented in SY 2024-2025 requires that weekly sodium averages per lunch do not reach above 1,080 mg for grades 9-12, 1,035 mg for grades 6-8, and 935 mg for grades K-5 (1). Each of these sodium limits is still well below what was prescribed to cardiac patients I previously worked with in an inpatient care facility whose sodium was restricted to 1,300 mg per meal due to heart complications. These sodium limit reduction goals are productive in that they encourage a heart healthy diet for kids. I think reducing it any further than the current targets may cause children to reject school meals due to taste. Our ultimate goal is to provide access to nutritious meals to students, which can only be done if kids accept the foods being served. I think the proposed whole grain and milk requirements will sufficiently support childhood nutrition alongside the fruits, vegetables and protein foods already being served daily. <br/><br/>1.

The restoration of milk, whole grains, and sodium flexibility (docket number FNS-2020-0038) in the schools should continue. Having healthy and nutritious meals in schools are important.  According to fact and friction on American food, 30 million children rely on free school lunch (Fu, 2020).   
 25 percent of all student rely on free or reduce school lunch. 45 percent of black and Hispanics kids leaves in high level of property and that’s there only meal for the day (NCES,2017).  Kids and youth need healthy food to help them grow and since the school meal are the only meal they need to be nutritious. 
In conclusion, it is important for the schools to keep serving these nutritious meals because some of the student rely on these meals and probably be there only meal of the day. Kids need healthy and nutritious food to grow, so I will encourage the FNS to keep serving healthy foods in the schools.

I have seen students be more accepting of milk since switching to the low-fat flavored.  When switching to the low-fat flavored milk sodium amounts will tend to increase; so to switch the sodium requirement and not give flexibility there would be saying no to flexibility on milk as well.  With all the options manufacturers give of whole grain items it really isn&rsquo;t hard to serve a majority of whole grain and most schools/districts do serve all whole grain except for those one or two things that are popular or not accepted if made entirely out of whole grain.  The rule of allowing some non-whole grain to be served without a wavier allows schools the flexibilities to pick students favorites to serve as non-whole grain so that they more accepting and excited about eating.  Also schools that do scratch baked  items are usually see more acceptability when they are not trying to make those baked items whole grain.

2020,FNS-2020-0038-0582,,Academic researchers,"To Whom It May Concern, 
I appreciate the opportunity to comment on this issue of changes to milk, whole grain, and sodium flexibilities in the schools. I also appreciate that school nutrition is a difficult area to manage as much of the time it feels like walking a tight rope between determining what would be best to offer from a nutritional standpoint and what would be best to offer in terms of what will actually be appetizing to the students so that the students are fed and waste is reduced.
I am writing to you as a dietetic intern who just spent the last few months completing a rotation with the food service department in the largest school district in Ohio. I have a degree in nutrition from The Ohio State University and am continuing my education through this internship with plans of becoming a dietitian, perhaps in the area of school foodservice. 
I think at this time that it is appropriate to provide schools that are participating the NSLP and SBP more time to reduce total sodium in meals offered. In a time when many schools are having to rely on shelf-stable meals to feed students, it would be quite a challenge to find a variety of shelf-stable meals that will meet the eventual sodium restrictions. However, I do believe that it is important to merely postpone this standard, not do away with it as research has found that children 6-18 years in the United States have an average sodium intake of about 3,300 mg each day.1 Childhood is a critical time for individuals to learn healthy habits that they can hold to over their lifetimes. So, helping children move toward the goal of consuming less than 2,300 mg of sodium per day could help prevent future disease associated with high-sodium intake, such as hypertension and heart disease. Schools play a significant role in helping to establish the norms for sodium intake since two meals a day are consumed at school. 
I also am in favor of the proposed change to permanently allow flavored, low-fat milk in the Special Milk Program for Children and in the Child and Adult Care Food Program for participants 6 years and older. Vit D and Calcium deficiency in the U.S. When looking at the National School Lunch Program (NSLP), research has found that after changing flavored milk to a low-fat option, children’s acceptance rate of that milk has returned to the same as it was when flavored milk was higher in fat content and participation in the NSLP did not drop due to this change.2 However, when flavored milk is removed from the elementary school menu entirely, overall milk consumption drops.3 This means a loss of essential nutrients like calcium, vitamins A and D, phosphorous, potassium, protein, etc. in a time of life when those nutrients are needed for development. 
The targeted change for the NSLP and SBP menus to require half of the weekly grains to be whole grains is a change I also find appropriate seeing that it follows MyPlate guidelines, which many of the students are taught in their classrooms. 
Thank you for the consideration that you have given to my thoughts and for the work that is being put in to make nutrition a priority in the federal programs that support access to food for so many individuals in the United States.

Many schools have had to adjust saturated fat in other areas of their menu to make the milk fit.  So, overall the nutrient profile of the menus have not been changed by this and the kids are drinking more milk.  That sounds like a win-win to me.<br/><br/>Allowing only half of the grains to be whole grain has added much more flexibility in the items that can be offered without the hassle of needing to apply for waivers for each individual item.  Biscuits, egg noodles, tortillas, and pasta are items that manufacturers struggle to make whole grain- rich.  In some cases, to make them palatable whole grain rich biscuits have more fat and sodium than their non-whole grain counterparts.  Most whole grain-rich and non whole grain items the schools are using don&#39;t vary that much in fiber content.  Saying everything has to be whole grain-rich is great in theory, but the reality is schools are dealing with a lot of processed food items where trying to make them whole-grain rich actually makes them less nutritionally desirable.<br/><br/>The kids are getting used to whole grain rich breads.  They are enjoying more fruits and vegetables. They are getting used to baked items instead of fried items.  The one battle we are still losing is with sodium.  Sodium is a taste preference that is changed over time.  Without meals changing at home to include lower sodium, the kids will always complain about the lower sodium meals at school. To ask schools to go any lower on the sodium requirements will negatively impact participation in the school lunch and breakfast programs.

HOWEVER, these current flexibilities in the FNS 2018 Final Rule are allowing school nutrition programs across the country to do just that without taking it ""too far.""<br/>The Healthy Hungry Free Kids Act passed in 2012 established standards for school nutrition programs that were too strict, overbearing, and resulted in financial loss in programs across the country. Since the majority of a school nutrition program&#39;s revenue comes from participation, these rules and regulations ultimately reduced student enjoyment and participation in school meals as well as increased food waste and student hunger when they returned home with empty bellies. Prior to these regulations in 2012, our school district was ahead of the game by incorporating scratch made menu items, whole WHEAT options (hot dog buns come to mind), and in turn, were gaining in student acceptability. Once the 2012 regulations passed, we actually had to go backwards - our district had to begin using a hot dog bun that had been specifically made for school nutrition programs to contain 51% whole grains and 49% enriched bread in lieu of the 100% whole wheat hot dog bun that we were currently using because it met a 1.5 oz grain equivalent instead of the required 2 oz. Because that makes sense?<br/>As I said previously, our district has and will continue to provide scratch-made menu options to our students.  HOWEVER, even by using these scratch-made techniques, our recipes do not meet the Final Target Sodium requirements when paired with FRESH vegetables and fruits as established in the 2012 regulations because the targets are so low. We make our mashed potatoes from scratch - milk, butter, and SALT. Potato pearls (dry potatoes that you add water to), are lower in sodium and would be much easier for us to use to meet the daily sodium requirement. So just to be clear - we are telling our children to add water to dry processed potatoes as opposed to boiling, mashing and making scratch-made mashed potatoes because this is healthier? Help me understand...This much of a restriction is in line with that of a kidney patient and results in bland, uneaten food items, reduced participation, and empty bellies. <br/>School Nutrition programs and school systems as a whole should be a resource for students and families to receive support - we are helping to mold and shape their children, teaching them how to make decisions and not make the decisions for them. It is our responsibility to TEACH them the healthier food choices NOT force them. Healthy meals are present in every school system across the country - why take a step backwards and lose these students over 1/4 tsp of salt?

It appears we have gotten away from feeding our students to becoming restrictive dictators as to what they should eat.  Classroom education about healthy food choices should be a part of the educational process and then the cafeterias can support and work together in creating the well rounded student.<br/><br/>Also, showing moderation and balance in meals would be easier implemented by withholding the sodium restrictions, allowing 50% whole grains and allowing 1% flavored milks.<br/>Thank You for considering granting the flexibilities or even eliminating the restrictive sodium, whole grains and milk fat requirements.

I&#39;m able to balance nutrient quality and food quality with offering the students their favorite foods.  As a Registered Dietitian, I&#39;m not only a menu planner but also a health and nutrition educator.  These flexibilities help me teach students about balance in their diets and on their plates. Further restrictions of the target sodium will adversely compromise the quality and integrity of the food.  We have found a happy medium and I&#39;m supportive of these flexibilities continuing to stay in place.  We want to nourish our future but the food isn&#39;t nourishing if it&#39;s in the trash. With these flexibilities, I have been able to use creativity and ingenuity to offer the students new foods, fan favorites and comfort items (like a white biscuit in Georgia) that otherwise they would not be able to access at school.  We don&#39;t want to isolate those kids that depend on school meals by offering them less than palatable foods and thus generating a cycle of not eating at school which results in not performing well in school which could have long term adverse effects.

I have greatly appreciated the continued, laser focus on program accessibility in concert with nutrition standards that when reasonably applied together, provide products and services that are appealing to students - including food items that are healthy - and ensure our program sustainability. However, the original HHFKA mandates on grains, sodium, and fluid milk caused significant participation decreases; students eligible for free and reduced-price meals are not accessing our services as they once did, and they choose instead to go without because the appeal of our offerings declined.    <br/> <br/><br/>Many of the foods that that we rely on to meet federal requirements are at an elevated price point because they are specialized for K12 operators.  Availability is contingent on supply chain logistics.  Palatability competes with student experiences outside school and in some cases, fully compromises the authenticity of certain items as replacements are of inferior quality because they do not maintain the cultural attributes students are accustomed to.  Combined, these few variables (not meant to be all inclusive) compound the challenges already experienced by Program operators to meet regulatory requirements, improve access for students by engaging them in our programs by offering foods they will eat, and maintain fiscally sound operations. <br/> <br/><br/>It is imperative that these three flexibilities be maintained for our programs to be sustainable.

2020,FNS-2020-0038-0687,,School,"First off where I work we are currently following the guidelines for the milk and have no problem receiving these products from the manufacturer.  The students have a choice of what they want.  Some absolutely do not like plain milk and others do not like flavored.  So this works out for everyone.  It&#39;s a win win.<br/><br/>When it comes to the whole grain flexibilities I believe that balance is key. I have actually witnessed when a child eats to much 100% whole grain that their body sometimes starts to have an allergic reaction to these ingredients.  Also most food that is modified and meets the 100% whole grain requirements doesn&#39;t taste all that great and has less acceptance from the students. So the 50/50 rule works. We want the children to eat their food and not waste it.  I will attest that some whole grain is beneficial, just not eating all whole grain 100% of the time you need that balance.<br/><br/>Then we have the whole sodium conundrum.  Right now in these unprecedented times it is hard to even get the food that we order from our food supplier.  Every week we have to sub items and most of the time it doesn&#39;t have the same nutritional value. It just isn&#39;t available and the cost is also higher.  In our kitchens we have limited amount of staff and limited equipment resources to fix more homemade items.  We don&#39;t even have a cook top. The sodium reduction affects food manufacturers also by costing them more money to develop these items, just for the schools. As a result this also hurts school nutrition by their prices going up for food cost and not knowing if child acceptance will be good or not we may loose even more money.  Food manufactures also need time to fully test products which is challenging and can take up to years to get the product just right.

Is the sodium going to be substituted with harmful additives, chemicals that can hurt our bodies worse than the sodium that was in the food to start with? ",In favor of flexibilies

Thanks for allowing us to comment on the proposed rule.<br/><br/>As a School Nutrition Consultant in North Carolina observing all school meals across North Carolina it amazes me to see the dedication of School Nutrition employees trying to increase participation that continues to decrease. They have attended classes in the summer on how to implement new delicious recipes meeting the sodium and whole grain requirements.  They have worked on customer service at the serving line and point of sale. They have worked on having an attractive eye appealing serving line. They have worked on marketing skills in social media to obtain students whom have never entered the cafeteria. They have even developed contest or games to entice students to be apart of meal times.  Last but not least have seen Supervisors walk around with a huge tray of a new menu item to allow the students to have a taste while in the serving line.<br/><br/>So my continued question to the School Nutrition managers and their staff during Administrative Reviews and Technical Assistance is why is participation dropping at breakfast and lunch. The answer is always the same due to whole grain and sodium the food taste different and there is not a lot of flavor. Children born and raised in North Carolina do need to eat more healthy, but my opinion is wouldn&#39;t it be better to offer students half of all grains a 100% so they would choose a grain verses declining the 100% whole grain.

I whole-heartedly support the proposed changes to the Sodium Restriction Schedule as well as the flexibilities for milk and whole grains. As I&#39;ve observed, 3/4 of our students will choose a flavored milk over unflavored every day. While Whole Grain certified items are much improved over what they were when I first started, some items are not readily available or are still not palatable to the children&#39;s tastes, IF we can find an acceptable WG alternative from a vendor. As we&#39;ve increasingly found since the onslaught of COVID-19, many prepackaged items are definitely not within the original targeted limits. Our district definitely cannot sustain our meal program participation without the continued flexibility in sodium requirements. Years ago, the repercussions of strict changes to nutritional requirements and meal patterns had a devastating impact on our participation, and ultimately our program funding. Even more devastating was seeing students bring in ""junk food"" rather than eating a healthy school lunch and in my opinion increased childhood obesity, rather than decreasing it. I appreciate the science behind the milk, WG, and sodium restrictions. However, our participation has been on the rise since the flexibilities were put into place.

2020,FNS-2020-0038-0695,,School,"I support maintaining federal nutrition standards to ensure all students receive healthy, well-balanced meals at school. I feel the overall effect of the 2010 Healthy Hunger Free Kids Act has been positive and the final rule on school meal flexibilities preserves strong standards, including Target 1 sodium reductions and limits on calories and fat. Students are introduced daily to a wide variety of fruits, vegetables, whole grain options and low fat or fat free milk. The flexibilities provided for milk, whole grains and sodium contribute to the palatability of the meals while continuing to provide healthy meals for our students.  <br/>The whole grain rich requirement of 2014 was very difficult to meet and still provide students with their favorite menu items.  Few families and restaurants serve only whole grains.  Especially whole grain pasta, which is very difficult to prepare in large quantities and maintain a good, quality product.  Even grocery stores have noticeably reduced their stock of whole grain pasta choices.  We took advantage of the waivers for whole grain when first became available and saw a significant increase in students choosing pasta dishes when we returned to preparing the dishes with non-whole grain pasta.  We experienced the same increase in participation when we returned to offering non-whole grain biscuits, with an overall increase in breakfast meals. We continue to offer many whole grain menu items, but the few items we changed to a non-whole grain option made an overall difference in our participation and student acceptability. <br/>The implementation of the Target 2 sodium restrictions is very concerning.  We significantly reduced the sodium content of school meals to meet Target 1, but not without complaints from students.  The Target 2 sodium restriction is very restrictive.  It is comparable to a low sodium diet in a hospital environment. However, we are not providing meals to hospital patients, instead, we are providing meals to young, healthy children.   Even the Institute of Medicine warned that meeting later targets may not be possible given naturally occurring sodium in foods and other challenges (School Meals: Building Blocks for Healthy Children, 2010).  With the Target 2 at 935, if offering milk and bread in the same meal, will use 35% of the sodium allowed for the meal.  A simple meal consisting of a turkey sandwich, made with low sodium meat and cheese, fresh fruit and fresh vegetables, without any condiments, will provide 975 sodium.  The sodium restriction will cause a hardship to offer cheese products, even low sodium cheese.   Many students prefer the meat alternate cheese option and provides a variety to menus. Maintaining palatability of some products will be very difficult if the sodium is reduced to lower levels in the product.  I highly recommend staying with the Target 1 sodium restriction.<br/>Some of the comments are that students are now familiar with the sodium restrictions and the whole grain requirement.  However, we have not yet offered the lower sodium restriction menu, and many schools took advantage of the whole grain flexibility. So students are not familiar with it.  For most students, this is not how they eat at home or at restaurants or purchase food from the grocery store. <br/>I recommend keeping the sodium Target level 1, and continue to offer the whole grain flexibility.  This will enable schools to continue to offer students food they will enjoy, and still maintain the healthy meals currently providing our students.<br/><br/>",In favor of flexibilies

2020,FNS-2020-0038-0698,,Advocacy,"The Council of the Great City Schools submits the attached NPRM comments in support of the USDA/FNS Restoration of Milk, Whole Grains, and Sodium Flexibilities for School Meal Programs.
The Council of the Great City Schools, the coalition of the nation’s largest central city school districts, submits the following comments in support of the November 25, 2020 Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) providing for flexibility to serve low-fat flavored milk, 50 percent whole grain-rich products, and to modify the excessive sodium restrictions from the 2012 regulations. The Council similarly supported the 2017 Interim Final Rule and the 2018 Final Rule, as well as recommended similar flexibilities in our original April 2011 comments to the Department of Agriculture.  The Council reiterates here our prior comments in support of this new proposed rule.  
Regulatory Process:  The Council traditionally has been wary of “end-of-term” regulatory revisions. Nonetheless, the regulatory positions of the Great City Schools remain consistent from administration to administration and do not vary based on time of year. More importantly, the Council consistently opposes the overregulation of school-meal programs that this proposed rule seeks to correct.  And, though the Council would have preferred more expeditious regulatory action in late 2019 to remedy the procedural issues cited by a federal district court, we note that the current pandemic-related school-meal waivers authorized by Congress and implemented by the Department already allow for more extensive program flexibilities in school year 2020-2021 than would be codified under this proposed rule.
Continuing Misleading Assertions: The Great City Schools again notes the assertions of harm to student health by advocacy groups in opposition to these three minor areas of school-meal regulatory flexibility, including thousands of boilerplate comments over the years that are overblown, impractical, and counterproductive to providing palatable and appealing meals for millions of school children every day. The Council finds nothing in the proposed regulations allowing low-fat, flavored milk, 50 percent grain-rich products, and maintaining existing sodium requirements (that have been in place for many years) that suggest harm to the health of students.
Reasonable Flexibility: The Great City Schools have notably opposed allowing junk food in our school-meal programs and continue to support virtually all the nutrition standards for school meals with the notable exception of unrealistic sodium targets. There is little justification for imposing on healthy school children the sodium restrictions equivalent to the diet of a cardiac patient. And while quality whole grain products are more available in 2020 than in 2012, many of the available products remain unappealing to students and negatively affect program participation, consumption, and plate waste. Further, offering low-fat, flavored milk provides an inviting incentive for students to participate in school meal programs. These very reasonable regulatory revisions contained in the proposed rule provide a better balance between prescriptiveness and flexibility.
Context:  Ever since the passage of the Healthy and Hunger-Free Kids Act (HHFKA), the Council has repeatedly highlighted the overly prescriptive, costly, and unnecessary regulatory requirements imposed on the National School Lunch Program (NSLP) and the School Breakfast Program (SBP). The HHFKA regulations add over $1 billion in annual unreimbursed costs to school meals and complicate the ability of school nutritionists and food service staff to provide attractive food options for students.
The pandemic and associated forced closure of the nation’s public schools has underscored the critical role of school food service programs in the lives of millions of students. Yet, school meal programs are in operational and financial crisis. Federal reimbursements are not covering program costs; labor-intensive grab-and-go meals strain operational capacity; front-line staff are often more at risk than other school staff; and program participation rates remain low. It is likely to take years for school meal programs to recover from this financial crisis and achieve program sustainability. While recent program waivers have helped in maintaining grab-and-go site operations, delivery options, ever-changing schedules, and hybrid and other school configurations, these short-term flexibilities have highlighted the need for less rigid federally imposed program requirements, including the three minor areas of flexibility proposed in the November 25th NPRM. Further relief from federal regulatory micromanagement of school food programs, particularly for meal pattern flexibility, is still warranted.
School food service programs have stepped up to fulfill an essential role in helping mitigate the hunger and economic crisis facing so many communities during this pandemic – in the same manner as school-based food programs have done locally in so many previous natural disasters. It is beyond time for federal policymakers to stop micromanaging local school meal programs and start allowing our front-line nutrition, management, and service staff to meet their students’ multiple meal needs in an appealing, efficient, cost-effective, and localized manner. The Council of the Great City Schools supports finalizing these proposed regulatory revisions expeditiously.

2020,FNS-2020-0038-0708,,School," As a Director of Child Nutrition Services. My experience in the School Nutrition Services for 18 years.  Robeson County schools is 100% percent CEP. Our district has seen a decline in meal consumption and waste with all the recent regulations to Milk, Whole Grain and Sodium. I strongly support this proposal below:<br/><br/>Milk: Allowing student to choose flavored low-fat milk varieties is likely to increase milk consumption. By increasing palatability of milk and thereby students milk consumption, students are more likely to get critical nutrients from consuming milk. This may increase program participation, which ensures that students get these key nutrients.<br/><br/>Whole Grain: The whole grain coating has decreased the quality and acceptance of products by students. Most of our students are not eating 100% whole grain products at home. By offering students half of all grains, they are exposed to more nutritional options and are being offered familiar foods.<br/><br/>Sodium: Sodium reductions has also decreased participation in School Nutrition programs. As our district is stretched financially and are limited in staff and resources due to this pandemic, scratch cooking is more challenging during this time and many rely on ready-to-eat or heat and serve items that are served for several days at a time. The more flexible approach to sodium reduction allow more time for product reformulation, school menu adjustments, food service changes, personal training, and changes in student preferences.<br/><br/> ",In favor of flexibilies
2020,FNS-2020-0038-0709,,School,"As a food service director in Kentucky, I want to thank you for proposing the restoration of milk, whole grains, and sodium flexibilities. I fully support these changes because I have seen our participation increase over the past few years when these flexibilities were available to us. In my district, students absolutely disliked whole grain biscuits. Our chicken and biscuit day is everyone&rsquo;s favorite breakfast menu. Even teachers and staff love that day. Comparing data from when we had to serve whole grain biscuits vs. when we had the flexibility to serve regular biscuits, it was about a 40% difference in participation. <br/><br/>School food service relies on its participation in order to be self-sustaining. Furthermore, our main priority remains feeding our students, no matter what background they come from. If we are not able to offer items that are appealing to children, then what is the purpose or our mission? If the meals we are required to serve due to rigid (and in my opinion outdated) guidelines are not appealing, students will simply choose to bring their lunch. Lunchboxes are typically filled with lunchables, candy, and other unhealthy foods. Again, this makes meeting our mission very difficult. <br/><br/>Having these flexibilities will allow school food service operators to rebuild their program after the COVID-19 pandemic. While these flexibilities are great, I do believe all guidelines need to be reevaluated. As a Registered Dietitian, I am baffled that sugar levels are not in any of the guidelines. For example, let&rsquo;s look at what a student must take at breakfast for the meal to be considered reimbursable: Grain (carbohydrate = sugar), milk (carbohydrate = sugar) and a fruit (carbohydrate = sugar). Research continues to show that diets high in carbohydrates can contribute to health problems later on in life, so why is the government requiring us to feed our children high-carb/high-sugar diets? Please consider reevaluating the dietary guidelines for these meals and please include Registered Dietitians on that committee. Our students need balanced meals (healthy fats, proteins, and carbohydrates) at both breakfast and lunch and the current guidelines do not allow us to fully offer that. <br/><br/>I appreciate that these changes are being made in response to feedback from Child Nutrition Program operators, and I want to thank you for considering our concerns and working with us to support our programs and our students. <br/>",In favor of flexibilies

Dear Ms. Namian:
On behalf of school nutrition professionals nationwide who serve healthy meals to fuel student success, the School Nutrition Association (SNA) appreciates the opportunity to provide comments in support of the proposed rule, Restoration of Milk, Whole Grains, and Sodium Flexibilities, published in the Federal Register on November 25, 2020.
This proposed rule would restore critical school meal flexibilities following the federal district court decision (U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland; April 13, 2020) vacating the 2018 final rule Child Nutrition Programs: Flexibilities for Milk, Whole Grains, and Sodium Requirements. The court ruling found that the final rule was “not inconsistent” with federal statutes; the only fault was in the rulemaking process. SNA strongly agrees with the court’s assessment that “USDA used its expertise to balance the nutrition science in the Dietary Guidelines with the practical considerations of implementation…USDA did not improperly consider student taste preferences, operational flexibilities, and the role of product innovation at the expense of student heath and nutritional science, but instead balanced these considerations against each other.”
SNA supports maintaining robust federal nutrition standards to ensure all students receive healthy, well-balanced meals at school, and the flexibility provided under this proposed rule does not compromise this goal. This proposed rule preserves strong standards, including Target 1 sodium reductions and limits on calories and fat, which ensure school meals do not contribute to obesity. School meals would continue to provide students access to a wide variety of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.
School nutrition professionals rely on regulatory flexibility to help them plan nutritious school meals that appeal to students in their communities. Schools struggled to meet the 2012 mandate that all grains must be whole grain rich due to regional and cultural preferences for a few specific items like white rice, tortillas, or pasta. Schools also reported widespread concerns about the availability of foods that will meet future sodium limits and are accepted by students. Even the Institute of Medicine’s 2010 report warned that meeting later sodium targets in a way that is well accepted by students may not be possible.
These flexibilities provide balance and will be especially important in School Year 2021/22 as COVID-19 related supply chain and economic disruptions will make it even more difficult to order and secure foods that meet highly specialized school nutrition standards. Smaller school districts and those in rural areas
with limited purchasing power or access to distribution channels already have few options when
selecting menu items. Meanwhile, school meal programs nationwide face crippling financial losses due
to extended school closures – a further impediment to menu planning and purchases in the coming
school year.
SNA appreciates USDA’s ongoing efforts to address these challenges and streamline regulations while
maintaining sound nutrition standards to benefit students. We express our strong support for the
proposed rule and respectfully submit SNA’s September 2019 amicus curiae brief detailing the
challenges addressed by these school meal flexibilities. Thank you for your consideration.

I do support the idea of food being more nutritious. We still do a lot of from scratch recipes. It is very frustrating to spend the time and money preparing meals only to watch them go in the trash. These flexibilities made planning a well-rounded, well-accepted menu a much better process.  <br/>Starting back in September I went through and updated all my labels and products to all the low sodium options I could find. Using products from K-12 companies specialized in providing nutrition approved products. After spending hours doing research, rearranging menus and changing products it barely made a dent in lowering the sodium numbers. There is not product accessible to accomplish the lower sodium target. <br/>I feel that the purpose of the NSLP program is to get good nutritious food to our students. That means that they have to actually eat it. It is important to offer a variety of healthy foods that kids like. if we take away the current Target Level, we reduce the availability of healthy meals that actually taste good. We then lose participation and that hurts our program. If the food doesn&#39;t taste good they will not eat it.

This helps streamline operations so that day care providers have to keep less types of milk on hand. For example, they can serve 1% unflavored milk to ages 2+ and can also flavor that 1% milk for any school age groups (ages 6+) that they serve. If this flexibility is NOT allowed, the provider not only has to provide whole milk for 1 year olds, but if they choose to serve 1% unflavored milk for ages 1-5 and want to serve flavored milk for school aged, they would have to buy and serve a THIRD kind of milk, SKIM for the flavored milk.

By setting achievable targets, this rule will result in more students eating healthy school meals, which meet calorie limits and offer a wide range of fruits, vegetables and milk.  Prior to these flexibilities, we saw participation decrease in our cafeterias because of the density of the 100% whole wheat tortillas and biscuits.  We also received, almost 80% complaints, that with the reduced sodium, the food was not appealing to students.  Further reductions will make it even harder to get students to eat in our cafeterias.<br/>School meal flexibility does not compromise the progress weve made for our students. <br/>We are currently sourcing all of our pinto beans, chile, fresh potatoes, and onions from local farms.  We will still continue to serve 51% whole grain + enriched wheat flour tortillas from Albuquerque, but need the flexibility in biscuits and some pasta.<br/>The proposed rule will help us prepare nutritious meals that appeal to diverse student tastes.<br/>Whole grains: A majority of the grains schools serve are whole grain rich. The flexibility simply gives us a little leeway on specific foods that students just werent eating, often due to regional and cultural preferences: flour tortillas and  biscuits.  We also face tremendous challenges with whole grain pastas not holding up well and kids not eating the pasta dishes. <br/>Sodium: Our schools significantly reduced the sodium content of school meals to meet Target 1 and are working toward Target 2 reductions.  We had to eliminate a number of our items like lasagna and most of our breakfast proteins (sausage, ham, bacon) because the manufacturers cannot even meet the required levels.  Finally, with the condiment restrictions, we have incredible waste in our vegetables because of small pc portions of ranch is not enough to encourage students to eat their salads and fresh broccoli.  It is a trade off with more fresh produce, but the ranch helps encourage them to eat them.  <br/>Even the Institute of Medicine warned that meeting later targets may not be possible given naturally occurring sodium in foods and other challenges. <br/>Naturally occurring sodium in meat, milk (naturally has 130 mg of sodium (25% of the whole breakfast) and other low-fat dairy foods would force schools to take nutritious choices off the menu. <br/>Many schools have already limited soups, entre salads and low-fat deli sandwiches due to sodium limits.<br/>Milk: Schools continue to meet calorie, fat and sodium limits for school meals, so any nutrient changes resulting from the addition of flavored 1% milk are offset in other parts of the menu. <br/><br/>We want to continue to make nutritious meals for our students, but the restrictions imposed by further target milestones and lack of flexibilities will greatly reduce our ability to be nutritious and enjoyable for our students.

Milk is a good source of calcium, potassium, phosphorus, and vitamin D in the diet of children 2-18 years. Low-fat flavored milk is highly nutritious and supports the overall health of children. Thus, to encourage students drink more milk when at school, I support maintaining the Milk flexibility in our state.<br/><br/>Whole Grains:<br/><br/>The proposed rule aligns whole grain requirements with the Dietary Guidelines for Americans and help maintaining the nutritional integrity of school nutrition programs.  This is not an effort to roll-back and decrease or compromise the nutritional quality of school meals.<br/><br/>Many schools in North Carolina encountered strong regional and cultural preferences for specific items such as enriched grits and biscuits. Manufactures tried to develop whole grain biscuit and grits.  However, the products were of poor quality and participation decreased significantly.  In our state, 100% of School Food Authorities requested and granted a whole grain waiver.  This flexibility allowed school nutrition operators to offer enriched biscuits and grits weekly which resulted in increased meal participation and less food waste while still providing adequate nutrition and contributing to the overall childrens well- being.  Therefore, to encourage student to consume more of school meals, I advocate maintaining the whole grain flexibility in our state.<br/><br/>Sodium:<br/><br/>As School Nutrition Programs are stretched financially and facing staffing challenges with limited  resources during the pandemic, scratch cooking is more challenging and many rely on ready- to- eat or heat and serve items which are often served regularly, meeting the original sodium target timeline is not feasible given the current environment and program constraints.<br/><br/>The National Academy of Medicine previously known as the Institute of Medicine (IOM) has also warned that meeting the original targets may not be possible given naturally occurring sodium in foods and other challenges.<br/><br/>A growing body of the research also suggests that the national recommended levels of sodium are too low. A 2013 report published by National Academy of Medicine indicates that there was no evidence of benefit for reduction of sodium intake below 2,300 mg/day.<br/>  <br/>A more flexible approach to sodium reduction allows more time for product formulation, school menu adjustment, recipe development, personnel training and adapting student preferences. Keeping the original targets may potentially lower the acceptance of meals which could negatively impact program participation, contribute to food waste and the overall childrens health.  Given experts recommendations combined with our own observation associated with changes in meal participation I, therefore, support maintaining the Sodium flexibility in our state.<br/><br/>Thank you for the opportunity to comment on the proposed rule. <br/><br/>",In favor of flexibilies

When offered food is overly strict and lacking ability for flexible eating, this does not promote a healthy relationship between the child and food. <br/><br/>To start, allowing flavored, low fat milk in Child Nutrition Programs will allow for greater acceptance and consumption of milk. The positive nutritional benefits of milk consumption on the growing youths body outweighs the potential concerns associated with the fat or sugar content in the flavored low fat milk. The fat can help absorb nutrients, and the flavor helps to entice consumption.<br/><br/>Secondly, offering whole grains is a beneficial part to a healthful eating pattern. Some items (such as regional foods) are not meant or made to be whole grain. This is where allowing a flexibility would be beneficial. Not all items can be made with whole grains or if so, the quality of the product does not turn out as well. Allowing for flexibility in the types of grains allowed will be more realistic. Child Nutrition Programs should promote whole grains as part of a healthful eating pattern, however mandating that each item itself must be whole grain causes strain.<br/><br/>Lastly, to talk about the sodium restrictions. I appreciate that the proposal is to eliminate the Final target, however it would be beneficial to eliminate the 2nd Target as well. The reasoning for this is due to the restrictions being difficult to achieve and ensure student acceptance. In my dietetic work history  sodium restrictions are difficult to adhere to in most all ages of the lifespan. If schools are to follow a rigorously low sodium diet, then the adherence to students taking reimbursable meals will decrease, as they will further have a dislike for school meals. Often, when manufacturers must decrease sodium in recipes, they add other nutrients to keep the flavor of their product  some of these nutrients added are sugar and potassium. The positive contribution of the nutrients from a menu offering a variety of fruits, vegetables, whole grains and low-fat dairy has a positive effect to help with preventing salt associated diseases such as high blood pressure. Therefore, if we continue to offer a healthful diet overall, with taking into consideration decreasing sodium intake, the students will be more apt to taking a reimbursable school meal. <br/><br/>Thank you for your time and consideration of allowing a public comment period.

Proposed: Allowing NSLP and SBP operators to permanently offer flavored, low-fat milk as part of a reimbursable meal and for sale as a competitive beverage. Also, allowing flavored, low-fat milk in the Special Milk Program for Children and in the CACFP for participants ages 6 and older.
o Response:  Fully agree. Children tend to drink more milk when it is flavored. Drinking flavored milks is more beneficial than students choosing to drink alternate flavored beverages with little or no nutritional content.
Proposed: Allows up to half of the weekly grains in the NSLP and SBP menu plans to be whole grain or whole grain-rich and any remaining grain items offered must be enriched. o Response:  Fully agree. This would allow SFA’s to provide a mix of both enriched grain options, as well as whole-grain rich options. Whole grain options are more expensive, and many times students do not like their flavor profile. Our district has found that it is possible to balance enriched grains and whole-grains within the menu and thus allow for enriched grain options of certain items that are more palatable to students. If students will not eat the foods provided because they do not find them appealing and palatable, they are not receiving the nutrients or benefiting from the program at all.
Proposed: Providing schools participating in the NSLP and SBP more time for gradual sodium reduction by retaining Sodium Target 1 through the end of the school year (SY) o Response:  Fully Agree. The school food industry will definitely need much more time to reformulate products to meet the Target 2 and Final Target requirements. In addition, lowering sodium levels to the proposed Target 2 and Final levels would greatly impact the flavor of foods. Students will most likely reject these foods due to decreased palatability. Again, if students will not eat the foods, they are not benefiting from the program. Studies have found that sodium reduction in children and adolescents is associated with small reductions in either systolic or diastolic blood pressure and others have found no blood pressure reduction with sodium restriction in children. There is not enough evidence to support reducing sodium levels to what is suggested by Target 2 and the Final Target.",In favor of flexibilies

Nutritional integrity is the number one concern for our students.  However, there are other considerations to also consider.  
• Meal participation
o Allowing students to choose flavored low fat milk is likely to increase milk consumption, students are more likely to get critical nutrients from the consumption of milk i.e. calcium, phosphorus, vitamin A,D, B12, riboflavin, protein, potassium, zinc, choline, magnesium & selenium.  
o Cultural relevance is important to keep in mind.  Some grain products are not historically whole grain i.e biscuits, tortilla wraps and grits.  Manufacturers attempted to deliver a whole grain biscuit and it was not successful; the product was poor quality and breakfast participation went down dramatically.   
o SFA’s report decreased participation/lower consumption of meals (particularly vegetables) due to decreases of sodium in recipes and food products
• Product availability (cost or vendor ability to respond)
o There are limited amounts of readily available and palatable whole grain options in School Nutrition.  Whole grain coating has decreased the quality and acceptance rates of the product and by students
• Pandemic constraints 
o Manufacturers ability to meet the demand
o Labor/product cost & logistics from non-congregate meal service when providing scratch cooking

2020,FNS-2020-0038-0773,,School,"The Minnesota Department of Education (MDE) is in support of the proposed milk flexibilities for the Child and Adult Care Food Program, National School Lunch Program, School Breakfast Program, and Special Milk Program.  Low-fat flavored milk contains a marginal amount of fat, which can provide more nutritional benefit to children in comparison to nonfat flavored milk.  It is also more nutritionally dense than other types of sweet beverages, such as juice.  Allowing low-fat flavored milk to be served provides school food authorities (SFAs) and child care programs additional variety in student milk choices.  This variety may increase overall milk consumption because some children prefer flavored low-fat milk over other types of milk.
MDE supports whole grain rich (WGR) flexibility. Historically, it has been nearly impossible for SFAs to serve 100% WGR products, leading to the need for the WGR exemption process. This process was inefficient and unnecessary. The proposed rule would give SFAs more flexibility in menu planning to provide students with a greater variety of grain products while still serving primarily WGR grain products. Allowing WGR flexibility will also let SFAs procure and serve grain products that are more culturally-relevant to their student population.  This, in turn, could increase student satisfaction and program participation.  
With this in mind, we do have concern that allowing SFAs to serve only 50% of their grain products as WGR will cause the nutritional integrity of meals to suffer. MDE would be more comfortable with 75% of grain products as the minimum threshold for the WGR requirement.
MDE supports pushing the timeline for meeting the Target 2 sodium requirement.  The timeline indicated in the proposed rule would allow manufacturers enough time to reformulate food products, and allow SFAs enough time to plan menus, to eventually meet Target 2 in SY 2024-2025.  Additionally, we do not want to add unnecessary burden on SFAs by requiring them to meet Target 2 as soon as they transition away from COVID-19 pandemic-related flexibilities.",In favor of flexibilies
2020,FNS-2020-0038-0774,,Advocacy,"TASN Comments to proposed rule, Restoration of Milk, Whole Grains, and Sodium Flexibilities.
The comments below are submitted on behalf of the school food service providers in Texas that are members of the Texas Association for School Nutrition.
Under the proposed rule, school meals are still healthy meals that meet calorie, fat and sodium limits and offer students fruits, vegetables and whole grains.
This proposed rule ensures schools continue to offer whole grains and lower sodium meals. By setting achievable targets, this rule will result in more students eating healthy school meals, which meet calorie limits and offer a wide range of fruits, vegetables and milk.
School meal flexibility does not compromise the progress we’ve made for our students. School meal providers have incorporated new, healthy menu items that students enjoy eating. Many school districts have increased scratch cooking efforts and purchasing from local producers. The proposed rule will help us prepare nutritious meals that appeal to diverse student tastes.
 Whole grains: A majority of the grains schools serve are whole grain rich. The flexibility simply gives us a little leeway on specific foods that students just weren’t eating, often due to regional and cultural preferences. In Texas we have seen an increase in participation when schools were allowed to resume using the enriched flour tortillas.
 Sodium: Schools significantly reduced the sodium content of school meals to meet Target 1 and are working toward Target 2 reductions. Schools have evaluated their recipes and reduced traditionally high-sodium items.
o Even the Institute of Medicine warned that meeting later targets may not be possible given naturally occurring sodium in foods and other challenges.
 Naturally occurring sodium in meat, milk and other low-fat dairy foods would force schools to take nutritious choices off the menu.
 Many schools have already limited soups, entree salads and low-fat deli sandwiches due to sodium limits.
 Milk: Schools continue to meet calorie, fat and sodium limits for school meals, so any nutrient changes resulting from the addition of flavored 1% milk are offset in other parts of the menu.

I support the meal patterns that include a wide variety of fruits, vegetables, whole grain options and low fat or fat free milk. <br/><br/>Restoring the mandate that at least half of all grains offered in school meals be whole grain rich is needed. Schools have done a great job in switching to whole grain rich items, but there are still some products that students have trouble accepting. In 2015-2019 when whole grain exemptions were needed, Michigan had over 180 school districts request waivers on certain items. The most requested items were pasta, bagels, pizza crust and English muffins. Manufacturers have improved many whole grain rich products, but there are still some with limited acceptability by students. Restoring this flexibility is in line with the current Dietary Guidelines for Americans. <br/><br/>Michigan saw milk consumption plummet when flavored milk could only be fat free. When 1% flavored milk was allowed, there was much celebration and milk sales increased significantly in Michigan. The nutrition in milk is very important for growing students. Restoring the flexibility for 1% flavored milk will help students receive the important nutrition it provides because they are actually drinking it. The minimal amount of added sugar in flavored milk does not have any adverse affect on student behavior. <br/><br/>I support the extended timeline for Sodium Target 1 through the end of school year 2023-2024, continuing to Target 2 in SY 2024-2025, and eliminating the Final Target. I have much concern about schools being able to ever meet Target 3. Some schools are struggling to have their complete menu cycle meet Target 1. Sodium is naturally occurring in milk and is required in the meal pattern. Grains items can be high in sodium because of necessary leavening agents required in their formulations. Manufacturers are doing a great job in reformulating products to be lower in sodium, but not all the sodium can be removed and have a satisfactory product.  <br/><br/>Nutrition and health of the students is top priority.

This flexibility aligns milk requirements with the Dietary Guidelines for Americans which recommend 2 cups per day with an emphasis on low fat or fat-free options. If we continue to allow our students to choose flavored low-fat milk varieties, the goal is to help our students develop palatability and increase milk consumption. One of the purposes of the School Nutrition Program is to provide our students with healthy and flavorful drink and food options while helping them establish healthy eating/drinking habits. As they increase their milk consumption, we are providing our students with important nutrients that will contribute to strong and healthy bones and provide other benefits such as healthy teeth, rehydration and improving their vitamin intake.  <br/>We must also continue the flexibility to allow for half of the weekly grains in the National School Lunch Program and School Breakfast Program menus to be whole grain-rich which is in agreement with the Dietary Guidelines for Americans which states a healthy eating pattern includes grains, at least half of which are whole grains.

Students do not eat all whole grains at home or when they eat in restaurants so why would we require that only schools have 100% of the grains being offered be whole grain.

2020,FNS-2020-0038-2734,,Manufacturer/food industry,"Dear Ms. Namian:
The organizations comprising The Grain Chain, a grains industry coalition from farm to table, support the US Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) efforts to improve the nutritional profile of meals in the National School Lunch Program (NSLP) and School Breakfast Program (SBP) while also responding to the needs of nutrition and food service professionals working in these programs. We believe the proposed rule, “Restoration of Milk, Whole Grains, and Sodium Flexibilities,” furthers that goal.
The grains industry is committed to doing its part, in partnership with USDA as well as with others in government and industry, to achieve healthier, more nutritious meals for our nation’s school children. However, it is critical that changes to school meals reflect the realities of school foodservice capabilities, as well as the need for food that is both healthy and appealing to children of a wide variety of ages. The proposed rule incorporates these important concepts while continuing to make progress in improving school meals.
Whole-Grain-Rich Flexibility
We strongly support the proposal to allow a minimum of half of the weekly grains offered
through the school meal programs to be whole grain-rich, with the remaining servings being
enriched grains. In this way, schools are given much-needed flexibility in accessing and
providing nutritious, good-tasting grain products to school children.
We further support USDA’s proposal to make the requirement for whole grain-rich offerings a
minimum rather than a maximum since Americans, including children, continue to fall short on
consuming the recommended amount of whole grain, an important source of nutrients of
concern including fiber.
Current intake data from the 2020 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee (DGAC) Scientific
Report provides continuing evidence of the particular need for increased whole grain
consumption among children. According to the consumption data presented by the 2020 DGAC,
youth ages 2 to 19 years reported a mean intake of 6.8 oz. equivalent/day of total grains, of
which 0.9 oz. equivalent/day were from whole grains, with 92 to 100 percent in this age group
consuming whole grains below recommended levels.
Cumulatively, research shows that a variety of grain choices, both whole and enriched,
consumed across all age groups contribute to nutrient density in the total diet and have the
potential to increase consumption of shortfall nutrients as identified by the 2015–2020 Dietary
Guidelines for Americans (DGA), particularly dietary fiber, folate, and iron.
While the benefits of whole grains are widely recognized, it is important that the proposed rule
specifies that the remaining grain servings in the NSLP and SBP be enriched grains. Enriched
grains have the three major B vitamins and iron added to levels in equal or larger amounts to
those in whole grain products. In addition, enriched grains currently provide more than 40
percent of fiber in a person’s daily diet. This fact is important to recognize when USDA prepares
the final rule.
Finally, it is also vital that federal nutrition policy be consistent. USDA’s proposal for schools to
make half the grain servings whole grain-rich is consistent with the DGA recommendation to
“make half your grains whole.”
Sodium Target Flexibility
The Grain Chain supports the flexibility in the proposed rule to allow schools additional time to
meet sodium reduction targets by retaining Sodium Target 1 through the end of SY 2023-2024,
continuing to Target 2 in SY 2024-2025, and eliminating the Final Target.
As the proposed rule states, extending the time for sodium reduction allows food
manufacturers necessary time to reformulate products, as well as for school menus to be
revised, and food service changes and personnel training to occur.
For example, sodium, as a component of salt (sodium chloride) and many leavening agents, is a
critical ingredient in the science of baking and positively affects taste, texture, and thus
acceptability by children and teens as part of the baking process. Members of The Grain Chain
appreciate USDA’s recognition of challenges like these facing the food industry in meeting
sodium reduction targets.
At the same time, grain food manufacturers are constantly innovating to address the nutritional
and taste needs of consumers, including children. Food technology advances are improving the
overall health profile of grain foods, including lower sodium products that maintain taste and
texture appeal.
More flexibility regarding sodium targets also allows time for adapting student taste
preferences to foods with lower sodium levels. A stealthy and measured reduction strategy is
more likely to be accepted by school children, thus it is important to recognize that no matter
how healthy and nutritious, children are unlikely to eat foods that do not taste good. The key is
to offer foods in the NSLP and SBP that deliver on both counts.
Finally, regarding sodium reduction targets, The Grain Chain appreciates USDA’s consistency
with DGA recommendations and the most recent Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs).
We appreciate the opportunity to provide comments and look forward to partnering with USDA
to improve the quality, nutrition, and taste of meals in the National School Lunch Program and
School Breakfast Program that feed America’s children, especially those in need.

The International Dairy Foods Association (IDFA), Washington, D.C., represents the nation’s dairy manufacturing and marketing industry, which supports more than 3 million jobs that generate $159 billion in wages and $620 billion in overall economic impact. IDFA members range from multinational organizations to single-plant companies. Together they represent approximately 90 percent of the milk, cultured products, cheese, ice cream and frozen desserts produced and marketed in the United States and sold throughout the world. The diverse membership includes numerous food retailers, suppliers, cooperatives and companies that offer a wide variety of nutritional dairy products and dairy-derived ingredients. Visit IDFA at www.idfa.org.
The National Milk Producers Federation (NMPF), established in 1916 and based in Arlington, VA, develops and carries out policies that advance the well-being of dairy producers and the cooperatives they own. The members of NMPF’s cooperatives produce the majority of the U.S. milk supply, making NMPF the voice of dairy producers on Capitol Hill and with government agencies. NMPF provides a forum through which dairy farmers and their cooperatives formulate policy on national issues that affect milk production and marketing.
This proposed rule will provide an additional option for the nation’s schools to provide a wider variety of milk as part of school meals, while still maintaining high nutrition standards. Allowing schools the flexibility to offer low-fat flavored milk supports key nutritional requirements specified in the 2012 regulation, including the calorie and fat upper limits. The restoration of the option of low-fat flavored milk in school meals can provide milk varieties that students will want to consume, helping to turn around the concerning reduction in school milk consumption.1 We also support the proposed allowances for lactose reduced and lactose free milk in the Child and Adult Care Food Program (CACFP). The flexibility for sodium requirements in school meal programs will permit schools to serve a wide variety of products that students enjoy while still lowering sodium content of the meals.
Low-fat Flavored Milk Provides Important Nutrients to School Meals
Milk has been a core element of school meals and other federal child nutrition programs since their inception. Milk provides eleven essential nutrients, including three of the four nutrients identified as nutrients of public health concern in the 2015 Dietary Guidelines for Americans (DGA)—calcium, vitamin D and potassium.i It is the number one source of these three nutrients of concern for Americans.
Flavored milks provide the same micronutrients as white milk, but with a flavor that many children prefer. Flavored milks, like all cow’s milk, are a source of 11 essential nutrients, including calcium, vitamin D and potassium. In a position paper from the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) about foods and beverages in schools, the AAP’s Council on School Health and Committee on Nutrition declared that “consideration of a beverage such as flavored milk provides a good example of the balance needed to limit added sugars and yet promote nutrient-rich foods.”2
Milk processors have significantly reduced the calorie and added sugar contents of flavored milk. Between the 2006-2007 and 2019-2020 school years, average added sugar levels declined by 57 percent, going from 16.7 grams to 7.1 grams in an 8-ounce serving of flavored school milk.3 In fact, flavored milk consumption has been found, in or out of schools, to only make up 4% of the added sugars in children’s diets.4
In addition to reducing the added sugars in flavored school milk, processors have also reduced the average number of calories. The average calorie content of flavored school milk declined significantly by 40 calories on average between school years 2006-2007 and 2019-2020.5 A similar survey also demonstrated that flavored school milk is just 25 calories more than the white milk served in schools.6
With these formulation changes, the nutritional benefits of low-fat flavored milk are available with slightly higher calories than white milk and the same or slightly higher calories than fat-free flavored milk. As FNS pointed out in the preamble to the 2017 interim final rule, an 8-ounce serving of low-fat flavored milk has only 20-40 more calories than the same serving of fat-free flavored milk.7 Some milk

7 The preamble to the interim final rule notes that low-fat flavored milk contains 20-40 more calories per cup than fat-free flavored milk. However, the USDA-ARS National Nutrient Database for Standard Reference (Release 28 slightly revised May 2016) reports low-fat and fat-free unflavored milks contain 102 and 83 calories, respectively, processors have been able to formulate low-fat flavored milk and fat-free flavored milk with the same calorie content. In fact, the USDA nutrient database shows the calorie content of 8 fluid ounces of low-fat chocolate milk is lower than that of fat-free chocolate milk.8 The USDA data also shows that the difference in fat and saturated fat content is relatively small: 1 g of total fat and 0.6 g of saturated fat per cup of low-fat chocolate milk and 0 g of total fat and 0 g of saturated fat per cup of fat-free chocolate milk.9 Switching from fat-free to low-fat flavored milk may represent a small increase in calories if any and a small increase in fat, without compromising on the excellent nutrient properties of milk.
Children consuming flavored milk in their diets had superior nutrient intakes compared to children that consumed only plain milk with no differences in body mass index.10 Another more recent study demonstrated that flavored milk consumption is associated with improvements in nutrient intake, but not associated with increased body weight of normal weight children.11 As a result, any concerns with an increase in calories contributed by flavored, low-fat milk can be balanced with appropriate meal planning.
Declining School Milk Consumption Has Significant Nutritional Implications
Both the 2015 DGAs and the 2020 DGAC report have identified dairy as a food group that Americans, including many children, do not adequately consume.12,13 Increased consumption of dairy foods, including milk, has been identified as an important change that Americans can make to improve the healthfulness of their eating patterns. According to the 2015-2020 DGA, healthy eating patterns, which include low-fat and fat-free dairy foods, are associated with reduced risk for several chronic diseases, including cardiovascular disease (strong evidence) and type 2 diabetes (moderate evidence). Dairy consumption is also linked to improved bone health, especially in children and adolescents.
The 2015 DGA recommended three daily servings of milk or other dairy foods for adolescents and most children, but the DGA also shows that nearly all age groups, including all school-age groups, of both males and females consume significantly less than the recommended amounts. While the 2020-2025 DGA have not yet been released, the 2020 DGAC scientific report included similar messages regarding the importance of dairy in a healthy diet, recommending 3 servings of dairy for most Americans.
If schools implement changes to their meal programs that would have the effect of reducing milk consumption, students are missing out on the 11 essential nutrients provided by milk. As the AAP paper on school foods highlights, schools that eliminated flavored milk found that less milk was consumed.14
An overall decline in school milk consumption has been identified, with reductions in both average daily participation (ADP) in school lunch programs and school milk consumption. Annual school and processor surveys conducted by the Milk Processor Education Program (MilkPEP), which is overseen by the Department of Agriculture, regularly found declines in milk consumption – specifically, a decline of 9 percent in total volume between the 2011-12 and 2015-16 school years. The percentage of reduction is even higher for flavored milk (12.5 percent),15 indicating that children are not pleased with the fat-free versions of flavored milk. This decline coincided with the 2012 regulations which, among other things, prohibited low-fat flavored milk in school lunches, breakfasts and (through a subsequent regulation) foods sold in competition with school meals. Until the 2011-2012 school year, low-fat (1 percent) flavored milk had been the most widely purchased variety of milk by schools.16
With the permitted reintroduction of low-fat flavored milk, 15 million gallons of low-fat flavored milk were sold in schools during the 2017-2018 school year.17 Data from schools in Texas and Oklahoma that reintroduced low-fat flavored milk in 2018 showed that this change resulted in an 8% increase in flavored milk consumption in schools, with a 2% increase in total school milk consumption.18
The School Nutrition and Meal Cost Study found that low-fat flavored milk was less likely to be wasted than unflavored fat-free or low-fat milk.19 If there is less waste with low-fat flavored milk, more milk and more essential nutrients are being consumed when low-fat flavored milk is a part of school meals.
It is important to restore with urgency the flexibility to allow low-fat flavored milk, as non-fat flavored milk is the only flavored milk available where COVID waivers do not apply.
School Meal Programs Should Adopt Policies that Encourage Increased Milk Consumption
The school meal programs are required to align with the goals of the Dietary Guidelines for Americans. As indicated above, the 2015 DGA and the 2020 DGAC scientific report indicate that dairy is an under-consumed food group and the Americans should consume more dairy, including milk. The 2015 DGA recommends low-fat or fat-free milk and acknowledges the potentially positive role of moderate amounts of sweeteners in making foods like milk and yogurt more palatable.
Therefore, policies that uphold the intent of the Dietary Guidelines, by increasing dairy consumption, should be a goal of the school meal and child nutrition programs and as demonstrated above, policies that eliminated low-fat flavored milk reduced milk consumption in school meals.
In the court decision vacating the final rule that had originally allowed for low-fat flavored milk, the court did not object to the inclusion of low-fat flavored milk as an option in school meals. In fact, that decision, as quoted by this Proposed Rule, confirmed that the 2018 Final Rule was consistent with the goals of the Dietary Guidelines.
With the current pandemic and economic situation in the United States, school meals are even more important sources of healthy foods and essential nutrition for American children. Continuing to allow low-fat flavored milk as an option in school meals will drive participation in school meals and increase consumption of milk and other nutritious foods.
Therefore, it is imperative that the regulations of the school meal programs include measures that will encourage consumption of milk. These policies would appropriately include low-fat flavored milk as an option in school meals for students who prefer this type of milk. Providing low-fat flavored milk as an option in schools also aligns with the preferences of American adults. A survey conducted for IDFA shows that more than half of American adults surveyed believe it is important to offer low-fat flavored milk with school meals.20
As previously stated, the allowance would not add calories or fat to school meals overall. While low-fat flavored milk may have slightly more calories and saturated fat than fat-free flavored milk, FNS’s regulations for the calories and saturated fat upper limits remain in effect. Allowing low-fat flavored milk to be offered would be balanced by reasonable menu modifications that would comply with the current Child Nutrition Program requirements. Schools have demonstrated that they are able to make these menu modifications through the implementation of the 2018 final rule and reintroduction of low-fat flavored milk to schools.
Lactose Free Milk in the Child and Adult Care Food Program
We support the proposed change to clarify that lactose free and reduced lactose milk is an acceptable option in Child and Adult Care Food Program (CACFP) meals and snacks. Milk with lower lactose provides the same important package of nutrients as convention milk, meaning that it is an important nutrient-dense beverage for those with lactose intolerance. If people avoid dairy completely due to concerns about lactose intolerance, this can adversely affect their intake of calcium, potassium and vitamin D --nutrients already lacking in the American diet.21,22 Since lactose free and reduced lactose milk will provide these same essential nutrients, the inclusion of lower lactose options in CACP is consistent with other federal nutrition programs and with both the 2015-2020 DGA and 2020 DGAC report.
Sodium Provisions
We also support the proposal to permit additional time for schools to meet the Target 2 levels for sodium and keep those sodium targets on a permanent basis. This would be helpful to the many schools that have found it challenging to obtain food items with lower sodium that are also acceptable to students, especially for school districts that are not set up for from-scratch cooking. The additional time would be particularly useful as school food authorities are currently undergoing significant changes to the school meal programs to adapt to restrictions resulting from COVID-19. Expecting a swift change to sodium levels would be unrealistic as this has not been one of the changes for which they had been preparing.
While there continues to be efforts from food companies to develop lower sodium products, there are some foods such as cheese for which salt and hence sodium serves a functional and food safety role that makes it particularly difficult to formulate new options. In cheese, salt promotes food safety by affecting fermentation, which can influence pH and water activity, while also preventing the growth of pathogens.23 Salt is not added to cheese beyond levels necessary for functionality and for food safety parameters. There are multiple hurdles to reducing sodium levels in many types of cheese, including technological feasibility, efficacy of salt substitutes and regulatory requirements. While some reductions may be technically feasible, the final product may not be acceptable due to flavor. In some cases, reducing sodium could result in product that would present a significant food safety risk, increased food waste and decreased shelf-life.
The regulatory requirements for meat alternates can also make sodium reductions more difficult. When cheese is used as a meat alternate in school meals, either on its own or as part of an entrée, 2 ounces of cheese must be served to satisfy the meat alternate requirement for school lunch. When cheese is used as part of an entrée and combined with other components of that entrée, such as sauce and crust in a pizza, the meal pattern requirements and functionality of salt in each component add further challenges to sodium reductions.
Conclusion
IDFA’s and NMPF’s members are proud of the nutritious milk and dairy products provided through USDA’s federal nutrition programs. We agree that the flexibilities proposed by USDA, particularly those related to milk and sodium, would continue to allow schools to provide healthy and appealing meals and beverages to students, while maintaining the key nutritional requirements of the Child Nutrition Programs.

2020,FNS-2020-0038-2750,,Other government agency - (non school),"It is important for the success of School Nutrition Programs and wellbeing of students to continue with the current flexibilities offered for Milk, Sodium and Whole Grain Rich foods. <br/><br/>There is no research to indicate that sodium should be so restrictive for children and adolescents in their diets. Sodium can be offered in modified amounts with the current limit, to offer products that are not too high in sodium, yet provide the flavor needed for students to enjoy their meals. It is much more important for students to eat food at this sodium level, than not eat any food at all. There is much waste associated with foods that are not palatable. If the students do not eat this food, it would lead to insufficient nourishment of the students at school, impacting their bodies negatively. There are studies that show there are more discipline problems, more absences, worse grades, and decreased learning associated with under nourished, hungry children. <br/><br/>Waivers were granted for school districts requesting to only serve half of the grain component qualifying as Whole Grain Rich foods. The justification submitted by school districts requesting this waiver included documentation that showed participation had decreased after the district began only offering all grains as whole grain rich. The numbers were compared from months before and then after the rule was introduced to only offer whole grain rich foods. After districts were able to offer flexibility in their menus, offering more than half the grains from whole grain rich products, participation notably increased. Many of the students&#39; favorite products are not palatable or of good quality when formulated as a whole grain rich product. Pasta, biscuits and breading are some of the favorite products that were not appealing to the students as whole grain rich products. Continuing with the whole grain rich flexibilities are very necessary to appeal to students. Palatability and appeal were assessed by school nutrition directors through comparison of participation numbers, taste tests, word of mouth, complaints submitted and surveys. All of the prior information has been provided by the majority of school nutrition directors in North Carolina. Particularly, I personally have received this information from more than 20 School Nutrition Directors in Northeast North Carolina. It is much more important for students to consume enriched grain products, then not consume any grains because they do not like the taste of whole grain rich products and choose to not eat meals at school.<br/>It is imperative to the wellbeing of students and the financial survival of the school nutrition programs that the grain, sodium, and milk flexibilities be made permanent flexibilities made available to these programs. <br/>",In favor of flexibilies
2020,FNS-2020-0038-2757,,School,"This is to request permanent restoration of the flexibilities for Milk, Whole Grains and Sodium
requirements for the following reasons:
Nutrition
Restrictive menu regulations do not guarantee better nutrition if students do not eat the meals.
 Actual observations show that more students select and drink flavored low-fat milk, instead of
unflavored. A review of vendor invoice statements also supports this finding.
 Our district was one of the 100% of North Carolina School Food Authorities that requested and
was granted a whole grain waiver. The whole grain dinner roll was not good and was replaced
with an enriched biscuit which improved student acceptance.
 Meeting the sodium restrictions now while providing menus that students will eat is a real challenge.
The Final Target sodium levels are stricter than a hospital diet.
Cost
 These flexibilities are needed to promote student participation in NSLP & SBP and avoid food waste.
 Foods that meet specialized school nutrition standards are often much more expensive.
Food Industry
 Manufacturers need time to reformulate foods to meet sodium target demands.
 Distributors already have supply chain issues due to current pandemic.
Viability of NSLP and SBP Programs
School foodservice operations depend on meal participation to be financially self-supporting.
Without these flexibilities, participation in these meal programs will continue to decline.
In my 40+ years of experience in nutrition, I have found that gradual changes, in moderation,
achieve better results.
Phyllis W. Newcomb, SN Director",In favor of flexibilies
2020,FNS-2020-0038-2759,,School,"My comments are in support of the restoration of milk, whole grains, and sodium flexibilities in the school meals programs. Allowing the milk and whole grain flexibilities are consistent with the Dietary Guidelines for Americans in that flavored milk can be low-fat and half of the required grains in the meals programs will be whole-grain. And, as stated in the 2015 SNA White Paper entitled, ""Sodium Targets in the Nation School Lunch Program"", sodium intake studies (both increased and decreased amounts) in children did not show significant changes in blood pressure. However, since the inception of lower sodium requirements, school meal participation has declined. According the the GAO, as stated in the SNS White Paper, participation declined by 1.2 million students in the first year when new dietary regulations were implemented. <br/><br/>Because the local School Food Authorities are responsible for being self-supporting, any regulation that causes a decrease in participation increases the probability that revenue from providing meals will be insufficient to cover operating costs. Allowing these three, small flexibilities can provide a small amount of buoyancy to a program that, in some instances, are barely solvent already.  ",In favor of flexibilies
2020,FNS-2020-0038-2761,,Constituent,"The restoration of milk, whole grains and sodium flexibility is critical to the success of the School Meal Programs.  In a time where families are struggling from the impacts of the pandemic that is taking it&#39;s toll on all Americans, it is critical to grant flexibility to the School Nutrition Programs that offer meals to students across the United States.  For many children, they find themselves in a situation where they only have two meals a day, and those come through the school cafeteria.  Prior to the implementation of the flexibilities that I am seeking to have restored, many of the students were faced with meals that were not appealing, had little taste and was a indicator of the family being economically disadvantaged.  For many, these students are commonly referred to as ""free lunch"" kids and only those that ""had to eat"" chose to participate in the program.  For many, not allowing the flexibilities to be restored, won&#39;t have an impact, as these households are of means that the children can bring in food from the outside, or in today&#39;s society can actually call a delivery service such as Grub Hub, Door Dash, etc., but for those that depend on meals to keep from starving, they have no hope and will find themselves in a situation where they will choose to go hungry than to try and eat a bland meal that has no taste simply because the upper elite believe they know what is best from a health stand point.  While these individuals seem to be well intended in trying to make meals at school healthy, in reality they have no clue what school meals are actually like.  Most do not have children in public school, but private school and the regulations that they are fighting against don&#39;t hit home for them.  School meals are not making student unhealthy or obese.  The calories are coming from other venues such as fast food restaurants and junk food that is not allowed in the School Nutrition Program.  Is government trying to regulate these type establishments, or is it just easier to try and implement changes in a business where the federal government is providing reimbursement for the meals served?  <br/><br/>I&#39;ve been around for a long time and have seen many changes have positive impacts on the programs, but to require these programs to offer meals that are so strict in sodium that food is not edible, does not promote a positive impact.  The very students that we are trying to make sure has at least two balanced meals will stop eating at all.  When they&#39;ve missed the two meals they depend on and go home to nothing, what do they have to look forward to?  I would guess that those wanting the flexibilities to disappear don&#39;t find themselves in a position where they count on two meals at school, many probably have chefs that prepare meals for them and their families.  <br/><br/>The School Nutrition Programs are facing economic challenges like never before.  The pandemic has not only impacted students, it has a devastating toll on the revenues that programs are generating.  They are doing all that they can to keep staff employed, food purchased and finding alternate methods to get the meals to the students.  They are working with transportation programs to deliver meals to students on yellow school buses, by personal cars, vans, etc.  They see the need in their community and they know who is dependent on the meals for survival.  The cash that many programs were able to save has been all but depleted since March 2020.  The number of meals served dropped drastically before the flexibilities were initially put in place and over the years and even with these added back, we won&#39;t see the same level of participation.  <br/><br/>In this situation, please keep the flexibilities in place, the students need the meals, the programs need the resources and those that believe that basically eliminating sodium and making everything whole grain, need to be required to have that same diet for a minimum of thirty days, they need to be required to come and prepare the food and serve to the students and they need to come up with ways to generate revenue that will provide the needed funds to pay for the higher cost items.  What good is having all these strict requirements that those opposed to the flexibilities are wanting, if the meals go unserved and students go hungry?  As was evident prior to the flexibilities, the only thing that didn&#39;t go ""hungry"" were trash cans, as students couldn&#39;t eat the food and just threw it away.  Is that what our nation has been reduced to, appealing to those that HAVE means while negatively impacting those that have no means and only want a chance at life?  <br/><br/>",In favor of flexibilies

Dear Mr. Martin;
The California School Nutrition Association (CSNA) appreciates this opportunity to comment on the proposed rule on meal flexibility. We also appreciate the agency’s willingness to provide these welcome flexibilities to schools. This comment echoes the comments CSNA submitted in 2018 for the interim final rule on meal flexibilities.
CSNA has long been in the vanguard in promoting and providing healthy meals to children in school. Following the last major revision in school meal patterns in 1995, CSNA worked closely with the Nutrition Services Division of the California Department of Education in piloting two alternative approaches to menu planning resulting in the highly successful SHAPE California system. SHAPE was explicitly identified as an acceptable alternative under the fifth menu option – Any Reasonable Approach – authorized by Congress.
The untested menu planning system put in place subsequent to publishing the final meal planning regulation in 2012, was immediately found to be seriously flawed as evidenced by the quick reversal of the requirement of caps on meat/meat alternate and bread/grain servings. The caps added unnecessary and redundant complexity and costs.
The flexibilities provided in this proposed rule are further recognition that the initial requirements, while well intentioned, were not realistic or reasonable. We support these changes and at a minimum recommend that they not be limited in duration as provided in the rule, but be made permanent changes to the regulations. That said, we believe that this rule provides an opportunity to make additional changes, and CSNA offers the following:
Milk
CSNA appreciates the flexibility that allows schools to offer 1% flavored milk. We believe that milk is an excellent vehicle for delivering key nutrients and essential proteins to children, and any effort to increase children selecting and drinking more milk is beneficial. The small amount of additional sugar in flavored milk should not be a reason for policies that may inhibit milk consumption.
Furthermore, recent research published after the IOM report and issuance of the 2012 regulations, has raised serious questions about whether fat is the health risk that it had previously been thought to be. Given the limits on calories and saturated fat in the menu planning requirements, schools should be able to evaluate what fits within their menu plan without the additional limitations imposed on milk choices.
CSNA recommends the elimination of all limits on the variety of milk, both flavored and unflavored, offered by schools, including the full range of fat levels.
Whole Grain-Rich
CSNA recognizes the value of whole grain-rich bread/grain foods in diets and supports efforts to increase their use in school meals. However, the requirement that all bread/grain items on school menus be whole grain-rich is costly and unrealistic. As policies issued subsequent to publication of the final rule demonstrate, among other things, there are some popular food items, including foods that fit within a variety of cultures, that cannot be easily produced as acceptable alternatives to their traditional ingredients. And, while the cost of whole grain-rich items is declining as demand increases, they still add cost to the meal.
The option offered in the interim final rule of extending the allowance of state issued waivers is unacceptable. Some reports have focused on the low waiver request rate as evidence that the need is small. These reports fail to explore why that is the case. The waiver request process is burdensome at best. The low rate is likely not due to low need, but to limited resources to request the waivers.
This is a good time to point out that the new menu planning requirements have added considerable cost to school meals without a sufficient offsetting increase in meal reimbursements. This effect has been most pronounced in schools with lower free and reduced-price meal participation. The cost burden has been born by school district general funds to the detriment of other education programs.
CSNA recommends that the regulations be amended to make the requirement be that 50% of all bread/grain meal components meet the definition of whole grain-rich.
Sodium
Perhaps the most controversial element of the current menu planning rule is the reduction of sodium. CSNA supports the interim final rule’s extension of the implementation at the target 2 level and, at a minimum, recommends that this be made the permanent level going forward. However, we also believe that even this target needs to be reevaluated based on current science-based research.
There has been considerable discussion over the past several years about what the appropriate recommendation for sodium in diets should be. The 2,300 mg/day goal identified in the Dietary Guidelines for Americans and endorsed by the World Health Organization and other health proponents may be appropriate for the 1/3 of the American population that is sodium sensitive. A study by the CDC found that, in fact, low sodium actually increases morbidity and mortality for most people. Other studies have pointed out that low potassium is a greater health risk than higher sodium consumption. And many studies have used a range of 3,000 to 6,000 mg/day as the ideal range for sodium consumption. Current consumption in the U.S. is about 3,300 mg/day, at the low end of this range. At the time the final rule was published, school lunch as a proportion of daily consumption was consistent with this national figure.
Furthermore, there are serious concerns about sodium targets and sodium alternatives as they relate to children. There is no research or evidence that the current target levels are healthful for children, or the long-term effects of lower sodium on child development or health. There is no evidence that reducing sodium consumption in children has any impact on development of taste preferences for salty foods as adults. And there is no research on the long-term health effects of the many alternatives to sodium that industry is exploring to replace salt in production.
There is research to suggest that the health risks of hypertension have increased over the past several decades while sodium consumption has been stable, suggesting that the increase in high blood pressure is not related to sodium consumption, and that the quick-fix of reducing sodium may not actually address the underlying cause.
In general, schools and the industry that provides the ingredients and food to them have found sodium target 1 to be reasonable and easy to attain. Similarly, target two may not be an insurmountable challenge, although it will impact the ability to incorporate cheese into school menus, which is a concern. However, as USDA admitted in the final rule published in 2012, target 3 is fundamentally unattainable. It is of great concern that USDA published a rule that built in failure. It relies on changes to manufacturing processes that could use technologies or chemical substitutes that pose greater health risks than the sodium they would replace without sufficient time to evaluate those risks, and without providing funds to offset the costs of developing these alternate approaches.
CSNA recommends that the regulation be amended to establish target two as the final sodium reduction, and reconsider the target pending the final evaluation of the voluntary sodium standards currently under development at FDA at a later date.
Fruits and Vegetables
While not addressed in the interim final rule, CSNA would like to comment on the current meal pattern requirement for serving, not just offering, increased quantities of fruits and vegetables. These requirements have increased cost and waste in school meal programs.
CSNA recognizes the importance of fruits and vegetables in children’s diets. Anecdotally, schools are doing an amazing job of offering a wide variety of these foods in attractive ways, and have seen significant increases in consumption of them. However, for children who do not choose to take and eat the mandated minimum quantity served as part of their school meal, the requirement increases cost and has a negative impact on children’s perception of the meal program.
As mentioned above, the menu planning requirements have significantly increased the cost of producing school meals without commensurate increases in reimbursements. The cost estimates provided in the final rule of 2012, based on questionable assumptions by the IOM, were that the cost of lunch would increase by 14¢, while schools that offer them would receive an additional 6¢ in reimbursement. School breakfast costs were estimated to increase by 23¢ for which no additional reimbursement was provided. The cost of the additional fruit and vegetable component contributes significantly to the increased cost of providing meals to children.
CSNA recommends the elimination of the minimum service requirements for fruit and vegetable components. Instead, we recommend incentives for increasing fruits and vegetables by providing additional USDA Foods entitlement funds dedicated to these foods, as well as other approaches to making them more affordable.
Again, we thank you for the opportunity to provide these comments and look forward to continuing this dialog in the future.

2020,FNS-2020-0038-2775,,School,"Dear Ms. Namian:
Thank you for the opportunity to comment in support of the proposed rule entitled, Restoration of Milk, Whole Grains, and Sodium Flexibilities, published in the Federal Register on November 25, 2020. It is my privilege to serve as the State Director, School Nutrition Division, of the North Carolina Department of Public Instruction where we administer the federally assisted school nutrition programs under the jurisdiction of the United States Department of Agriculture. Collectively, we serve, support and ultimately oversee the administration and operation of the National School Lunch Program (NSLP) and School Breakfast Program (SBP), and other federal food assistance programs in nearly 2,800 public and non-public schools and serve over 1.5 million students, of which nearly 60% are economically disadvantaged and often food-insecure.
As the State Director, I am pleased to support the proposed rule which would effectively restore critical school nutrition program flexibilities following the federal district court decision (U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland, dated April, 13, 2020) vacating the 2018 final rule on Child Nutrition Programs: Flexibilities for Milk, Whole Grains, and Sodium Requirements. As you are aware, the court ruling found that the final rule was not inconsistent with federal statues; the only fault was in the rulemaking process itself. In its ruling, the court opined that “the USDA used its expertise to balance the nutrition science in the Dietary Guidelines with the practical considerations of implementing, and as such, USDA did not improperly consider student taste preferences, operational flexibilities and the role of product innovation at the expense of student health and nutritional science, but instead balanced these considerations against each other.”
As a Registered Dietitian and Licensed Dietitian/Nutritionist, I am committed to supporting a state-wide School Nutrition Program that provides wholesome, nutritious, appealing, affordable meals for students that not only support daily nutrition needs, but also support the development of lifelong healthful eating habits. Meals provided under the NSLP and SBP during the instructional day support students’ optimal growth, development and health while also supporting their academic and future success. These programs provide critical food safety nets for many households, so it is critical for students to not only have access to meals and adequate time to consume them, they must also be palatable and appealing to students so they will want to consume them. The flexibilities reinstated under this proposed rule do not compromise the nutritional integrity of these programs nor are they an effort to “roll back” nutrition standards; instead, they promote student palatability, menu variety and ultimately student consumption of the meals provided for them. These flexibilities enable school nutrition professionals in North Carolina and other states to plan and prepare meals that include a wide variety of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, low-fat milk and lean proteins, all of which are consistent with the Dietary Guidelines for Americans.
Allowing half of the weekly grains offered through the school meal programs to be whole grain-rich when
balanced with other nutritious grain options is consistent with the 2015 – 2020 Dietary Guidelines for
Americans. A healthful combination of whole grain-rich products along with refined grains that are
enriched with iron and B vitamins (thiamin, riboflavin, niacin, and folic acid) provides key nutrients vital
to student’s health. While the nutrient contribution is important, cultural acceptance is also a factor in
planning nutritious meals for children. Many cultural favorites are excluded from school meals when all
grains must meet the arbitrary requirement of being whole grain-rich. Balance is critical in helping
students learn to develop lifelong healthful eating habits; specifically, providing a balance of whole grainrich
and enriched grain products supports the inclusion of many culturally relevant foods while exposing
students to more whole grain-rich products.
Reinstatement of sodium flexibilities is also important. North Carolina’s school nutrition professionals
have done an incredible job of decreasing the sodium content of school meals over the past decade, and
they continue to develop and utilize recipes that support the continued gradual reduction of sodium.
Unfortunately, student acceptance of sodium-restricted foods has been problematic, resulting in food waste
and a decline in student meal participation. The implementation of further sodium reductions at this time
is counterproductive to helping students meet daily nutrition requirements or developing lifelong healthful
eating habits. If students choose not to consume foods that meet the sodium restrictions, the nutrients
provided by the meals are not available to them; ultimately this undermines the purpose of the school
nutrition programs. Even the Institute of Medicine (2010) opined that, “reducing the sodium content of
school meals as specified (in Targets 2 and 3) and in a way that is well accepted by students will present
major challenges and may not be possible.” North Carolina’s school nutrition programs are experiencing
challenges with student acceptance related to the sodium content of foods. Delaying Target 2 sodium
levels for an additional four years will allow time for School Nutrition professionals and the K-12 food
industry to continuously improve and reformulate products to meet sodium requirements, while continuing
to enhance flavor profiles that appeal to students.
Finally, flexibilities to allow for low-fat milk should also be reinstated. As with other flexibilities, the
proposed rule aligns milk requirements with the Dietary Guidelines for Americans which recommends
healthy eating patterns that include fat-free or low-fat dairy, including milk. The fat content in low-fat
milk promotes the efficient absorption of fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E, and K; it also increases satiety.
Ultimately, reinstatement of the proposed rule encourages an increase in the overall student consumption
of milk which will, in turn, increase their consumption of other important nutrients including calcium,
phosphorus, vitamin A, vitamin D, riboflavin, vitamin B12, protein, potassium, zinc, choline, magnesium,
and selenium.
Again, thank you for the opportunity to comment on the proposed rule. Your continued efforts to support
overall program integrity and streamline regulations, while maintaining strong nutrition standards that
support students’ optimal growth, development and academic success are greatly appreciated.

2020,FNS-2020-0038-2814,,School,"The correlation between student participation in the NSLP and SBP, financial solvency of School Nutrition programs across the nation and the implementation of the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kid Act with severe restrictions on milk, grains and sodium are astounding. As a school nutrition director in a rural southern school district, having the flexibilities with milk, grains and sodium directly affects our food/milk choices we offer and the flavor of our made from scratch meals by having a positive impact on student participation and acceptance of the school food we offer. A child choosing to forego a meal because the hamburger bun is brown and tough or there is no flavor in their cooked vegetables or entre is detrimental to our students health and their growing minds and bodies. Most school districts expect school nutrition departments to maintain a self-supporting status which requires food choices (meeting requirements) available and palatable to students ensuring participation in our program. <br/>I believe this is a commonsense decision. If you review actual data on student participation in the NSLP and SBP after the implementation of HHFKA you will see an extreme decline in North Carolina and across the nation.  You will also find studies reporting huge amounts of plate waste that continues due to HHFKA regulations. In order to discuss the nutritional benefits food may have or not have in children a child must select the food AND consume it. This is where is problem lies within the regulations as written.

The District Court continued by stating that Congress has the authority to limit the factors the USDA considers when promulgating rules, but that it had not explicitly chosen to do so.

2020,FNS-2020-0038-2822,,Manufacturer/food industry,"The National Turkey Federation (NTF) appreciates the opportunity to submit the following comments to
the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) Food, Nutrition and Consumer Service’s (FNCS) in response
to the Proposed Rule: Restoration of Milk, Whole Grains, and Sodium Flexibilities. NTF represents nearly
100 percent of all turkey processors, growers, breeders, hatchery owners and allied companies. It is the
only national trade association representing the turkey industry exclusively. NTF and its members are
pleased to work with USDA and individual school districts to provide school meals that are not only
nutritious but also taste good.
The Importance of Protein
Protein is important for growth, strength and muscle maintenance in school-age children. The 2015-
2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans advises that a healthy diet includes ""A variety of protein foods,
including seafood, lean meats and poultry, eggs, legumes (beans and peas), and nuts, seeds, and soy
products.”1 Protein is essential for the development and maintenance of muscle, including brain
development. Yet, according to What We Eat in America, NHANES 2007-2010, approximately 50% of
boys and girls 9-13 years of age are not meeting their protein requirement, meeting only, on average,
4.1-oz equivalents of the recommended 4-6 oz. needed. The problem is even worse as girls get older.
Over 70% of girls aged 14-18 are not meeting their protein intake, meeting only, on average, 4.2 oz.
equivalents of the recommended 5-6.5 oz.2 This is further corroborated by the National Growth and
Health Study, which found that “more than 75% [of girls] consumed less than the recommended
amounts in the “meat” group” leading to nutrient disparities in the vast majority of school-aged girls.3
This protein deficiency is quite troubling and one we urge the USDA to consider as it makes further
changes to the school meals programs.
As a low-fat, high-protein option, turkey is an excellent protein choice for school meals. One 3.5 oz. (100
gram) serving of boneless, skinless turkey breast contains about 25 grams of protein, <1 gram of fat and
0 grams of saturated fat and children like it. Turkey is also a strong source of niacin, vitamin B6, and
phosphorus and a good source of B5, zinc as well as of iron and potassium; all of which are important
nutrients for school-age children.4
NTF urges USDA to promote consumption of turkey and review protein requirements as it makes further
changes to school meals.
Sodium Flexibilities Should be Finalized
Turkey is “naturally low” in sodium, an essential nutrient. A 3.5-oz. portion of turkey breast has only 68
mg of sodium, approximately 2% of the recommended dietary allowance.3 According to the USDA
Nutrient database, fresh turkey is an extremely small contributor to sodium intake. An average fresh
turkey product contributes 69 mg of sodium per 3 oz. with a range on the lowest end from 43 mg
(ground turkey) to 105 mg at the highest end (whole turkey dark meat).5
However, some further processed turkey products contribute some sodium to the diet.1 Given the
nature of further processed meat products – and in particular lunchmeats – some level of sodium is
required for food safety reasons. Given these products are important for their nutrient contributions,
and also for their affordability, accessibility, simplicity, and ease of preparation, they are valued foods on
school meal trays across the country.
For many children, school meals are the primary source of nutrition. Ensuring they have access to
nutritious food they will eat is essential. Failing to meet essential nutrition needs harms the public
health of our school children. The turkey industry continues to work to provide a variety of options to
meet consumer’s sodium-related needs including “no salt added” and “lower sodium” products, but
children have different expectations than adults. Ensuring that they have adequate time to adapt to
different tastes, and ultimately will consume the food served, is critical to getting it right. Without
attention to these important details, we could see some troublesome unintended consequenses. For example, before the flexibilities were provided by USDA, NTF staff were told by school food service
directors that in some areas, students started selling small salt packets in schools. While creative, this is
not a desired outcome of the policies.
For these many reasons, NTF requests USDA finalize its Proposed Rule on Sodium Targets.

• The proposed rule aligns milk requirements with the Dietary Guidelines for Americans and maintains the nutritional integrity of school nutrition programs.  This is not an effort to roll-back and decrease or compromise the nutritional quality of school meals.
 The 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommends healthy eating patterns that include “fat-free or low-fat dairy, including milk…”
 “Fat-free and low-fat (1%) dairy products provide the same nutrients but less fat (and thus, fewer calories) than higher fat options, such as 2% and whole milk and regular cheese. Fat-free or low-fat milk and yogurt, in comparison to cheese, contain less saturated fats and sodium and more potassium, vitamin A, and vitamin D. Thus, increasing the proportion of dairy intake that is fat-free or low-fat milk or yogurt and decreasing the proportion that is cheese would decrease saturated fats and sodium and increase potassium, vitamin A, and vitamin D provided from the dairy group.” (2015-2020 DGAs, pg. 23)
 Fat content in low-fat milk promotes fat soluble vitamin absorption (A, D, E, and K), as well as increases satiety.
• The proposed rule encourages an increase in student consumption of milk.
 Allowing students to choose flavored low-fat milk varieties is likely to increase milk consumption due to increased palatability and preference of this milk type among students. By increasing palatability of milk, and thereby student milk consumption, students are more likely to get critical nutrients from consuming milk, including calcium, phosphorus, vitamin A, vitamin D, riboflavin, vitamin B12, protein, potassium, zinc, choline, magnesium, and selenium. This may also lead to increased program participation, which ensures that more students will get these key nutrients for growth and development on a daily basis through USDA School Nutrition Programs.
Allowing half of the weekly grains offered through the school meal programs to be whole grain-rich
 The proposed rule aligns whole grain requirements with the Dietary Guidelines for Americans and maintains the nutritional integrity of school nutrition programs.  This is not an effort to roll-back and decrease or compromise the nutritional quality of school meals.
 Dietary Guidelines for Americans 2015-2020 recommend making at least half of the daily requirements for grains whole grains.
 Dietary Guidelines for Americans 2015-2020 state that “Most refined grains are enriched, a process that adds back iron and four B vitamins (thiamin, riboflavin, niacin, and folic acid).”  Refined grain products can still provide key nutrients vital to our student’s health.  
 It is important to consider the overall healthfulness of foods served as well as their whole grain content. Foods that are made with whole grains may also have high levels of sugar or saturated fat, including many breakfast options.  Whole grain increases nutritional value some, but it is confusing to the customer to taunt whole grain as a standard for all grain food products, without looking at the whole product.  
• Student Preference/Palatability/Product Availability/Cultural Considerations 
 Product quality, texture, appearance, availability have been concerns with 100% whole grain products.  This resulted in a significant decrease in participation and increased waste when 100% whole grains were incorporated into recipes.
o Biscuits - Whole grain biscuits were introduced in the 2013-2014 school year. Manufactures tried to execute a whole grain biscuit and it was not successful; the product was of poor quality and breakfast participation went down dramatically.   Whole grain biscuits were introduced in the 2013 – 2014 school year.  During this year and the following year, breakfast participation decreased by over 110,000 meals when whole grain biscuits were available to students.  
o Whole grain tortillas are most often enriched and not whole grain.  Sandwich wraps, burritos or fajitas made with enriched instead of whole grain flour could be more popular among students, thereby increasing participation and still providing adequate nutrition.
o Pasta (spaghetti, macaroni, rotini) – The taste and texture of the whole grain pasta has not been appealing to students. Cafeteria staff reported an increase in food waste of these items and a decrease in participation.  It is also more difficult to maintain the quality of the product once cooked, requiring more staff to prepare the product as needed.   Due to these concerns, we decreased the frequency in which we offer our scratch made pasta dishes from twice a week to once a week.
o Bread products:  The 100% whole wheat bread was very dark and had a strong wheat taste.  100% whole wheat loaf bread when grilled or toasted became very dark in color.  This was not appealing to the students and we had very poor acceptance of this product.  Many students would remove the bread when consuming sandwiches.
• 100% of North Carolina School Food Authorities requested and were granted a whole grain waiver.  This demonstrates the critical need for whole grain flexibility in North Carolina.  
• According to the SNA School Nutrition Trends 2019 Report the following barriers are reported with serving 100% whole grain products: Student acceptance (71.9%), product availability (22 %), recipe/product remains the most significant barrier.  
• There are limited amounts of readily available and palatable whole grain options in School Nutrition, such as whole wheat bread, oatmeal, brown rice.  Other whole grain options are generally credited in the breading of school meal entrees.  The whole grain coating has decreased the quality and acceptance rates of the product and by students.
• Most of our students are not eating 100% whole grain products at home.  At least by offering students half of all grain’s 100% whole grains, they are exposed to more nutritional options and are being offered familiar foods as well.  For all students it is important to provide options they will eat.  
• Cultural relevance is important to keep in mind.  Some grain products are not historically whole grain.  For example, biscuits, tortilla wraps, grits and spaghetti. Flexibility is key in feeding children.  If we want our students to receive adequate nutrition in order to be successful in the classroom, food choices and actual consumption of the foods offered is important.   
Providing schools more time for gradual sodium reduction by retaining Sodium Target 1 through the end of SY 2023-2024, continuing to Target 2 in SY 2024-2025, and eliminating the Final Target. 
• Sodium flexibilities take into account the Dietary Guidelines for Americans and other factors.
 “The District Court found that the USDA examined relevant data when it considered student taste preferences, operational flexibilities, and product innovation in formulating the 2018 Final Rule. Although USDA is required to consider certain factors, including nutritional science and the Dietary Guidelines, in establishing standards for the school meal programs, see, e.g., 42 U.S.C. 1758(a)(1)(A), 1773(e)(1), this requirement does not exclude other factors from USDA's consideration.

 Meeting later sodium targets might not be possible because of naturally occurring sodium in foods-Institute of Medicine-Fact Sheet from SNA
• Student Preferences
 SFAs report decreased participation and lower consumption of meals (particularly vegetables) due to decreases of sodium in recipes and food products.
 During a 2015 observation of plate waste in Cumberland County NC, as much as 70% of vegetables chosen by students were discarded.  While recipes have been modified, plate waste continues to remain high with feedback on product taste being that the vegetables need more salt for flavor.
o Green Beans – 54% waste
o Pinto Beans – 33% waste
o Carrots – 36% waste
o Corn – 30% waste
o Sweet Potato – 60% waste
o Collard Greens – 70% waste
 “FNS must ensure continued participation in the program during this process—if children will not eat the healthy food served in schools, children are not benefiting from the nutrition standards enacted. Students need to eat the food to acquire the nutrition, meaning we need to increase participation and decrease food waste.” (Proposed Rule pg. 75245)
• Operational Considerations
 As SN Programs are stretched financially and are limited in staff and resources due to the pandemic, scratch cooking is more challenging during this time and many rely on ready-to-eat or heat and serve items that are often served for several days at a time. These items often have higher sodium content to improve shelf life. Meeting the original sodium target timeline during this time is not feasible given the current environment and program constraints. 
 Delaying Target 2 for an additional four years will allow time for the industry to reformulate ingredients to meet target 2 sodium demands.  Our industry cannot meet current demands due to the constraints and new food service models operating to feed our students under the current pandemic.  
 “As a food ingredient, sodium has multiple uses, such as in curing meat, baking, thickening, enhancing flavor (including the flavor of other ingredients), as a preservative, and in retaining moisture. For example, some fresh meats have sodium solutions added to help retain moisture in cooking.”  (2015-2020 DGAs, pg. 34)
 “This more flexible approach to sodium reduction allows more time for product reformulation, school menu adjustments, food service changes, personnel training, and changes in student preferences. Keeping the original date for Sodium Target 2 could potentially lower the acceptance of meals by students, who are currently accustomed to eating foods with higher sodium content outside of school. This could negatively impact program participation and contribute to food waste. Regarding elimination of the Final Target, the District Court found that it was within USDA's discretion to wait until after the new Dietary Guidelines and DRIs were released to set any final targets for sodium content. The District Court found that the USDA adequately explained and acknowledged its shift in policy from the 2012 Final Rule to the 2018 Final Rule.” (Proposed Rule pg. 75244)

2020,FNS-2020-0038-2882,,School,"I appreciate the opportunity to submit comments to the U. S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) on the Proposed Rule: Restoration of Milk, Whole Grains, and Sodium Flexibilities. 
As a professional in the School Nutrition Program for 20 years, I want to ensure all students receive healthy and well-balanced meals at school and to promote long-term health and academic success.  I strongly support maintaining robust federal nutrition standards while allowing School Nutrition Programs additional menu planning flexibilities to permanently offering low-fat flavored milk as part of a reimbursable meal and for sale as a competitive beverage, allowing for half of the weekly grains in the school meal menus to be whole grain-rich, and providing schools participating in the National School Lunch Program and School Breakfast Programs more time for gradual sodium reduction by retaining Sodium Target 1 through the end of school year (SY) 2023-2024, continuing to Target 2 in SY 2024- 2025, and eliminating the Final Target.  
 Allowing flavored, low-fat milk in the Child Nutrition Programs
• The proposed rule aligns milk requirements with the Dietary Guidelines for Americans and maintains the nutritional integrity of school nutrition programs.  This is not an effort to roll-back and decrease or compromise the nutritional quality of school meals.
It has been proven that when schools offer low-fat flavored milks, students not only drink more milk — they are more likely to participate in the school meal programs and waste less food, which may help in acquiring more vitamins and nutrients that otherwise may be deficient in their diet. Milk is a good source of calcium, potassium, phosphorus, and vitamin D in the diet of children 2-18 years. Low-fat flavored milk is highly nutritious and supports the overall health of children. Thus, to encourage students drink more milk when at school, I support maintaining the Milk flexibility in our state.
 Allowing half of the weekly grains offered through the school meal programs to be whole grain-rich
• The proposed rule aligns whole grain requirements with the Dietary Guidelines for Americans and maintains the nutritional integrity of school nutrition programs.  This is not an effort to roll-back and decrease or compromise the nutritional quality of school meals.
Many schools in North Carolina encountered strong regional and cultural preferences for specific items such as enriched grits and biscuits. Manufactures tried to develop whole grain biscuit and grits.  However, the products were of poor quality and participation decreased significantly.  In our state, 100% of School Food Authorities requested and granted a whole grain waiver.  This flexibility allowed school nutrition operators to offer enriched biscuits and grits weekly which resulted in increased meal participation and less food waste while still providing adequate nutrition and contributing to the overall children’s well- being.  Therefore, to encourage student to consume more school meals, I advocate maintaining the whole grain flexibility in our state.
 Providing schools more time for gradual sodium reduction by retaining Sodium Target 1 through the end of SY 2023-2024, continuing to Target 2 in SY 2024-2025, and eliminating the Final Target. 
 Meeting later sodium targets might not be possible because of naturally occurring sodium in foods-Institute of Medicine-Fact Sheet from SNA
 As SN Programs are stretched financially and are limited in staff and resources due to the pandemic, scratch cooking is more challenging during this time and many rely on ready-to-eat or heat and serve items that are often served for several days at a time. These items often have higher sodium content to improve shelf life. Meeting the original sodium target timeline during this time is not feasible given the current environment and program constraints. 
A growing body of the research also suggests that the national recommended levels of sodium are too low. A 2013 report published by National Academy of Medicine indicates that there was no evidence of benefit for reduction of sodium intake below 2,300 mg/day.  A more flexible approach to sodium reduction allows more time for product formulation, school menu adjustment, recipe development, personnel training and adapting student preferences. Keeping the original targets may potentially lower the acceptance of meals which could negatively impact program participation, contribute to food waste and the overall children’s health.  Given experts recommendations combined with our own observation associated with changes in meal participation I, therefore, support maintaining the Sodium flexibility in our state.

2020,FNS-2020-0038-2889,,Manufacturer/food industry,"Dear Mr. Martin:
The undersigned dairy farmer-owned cooperatives and producer associations strongly support the restoration of schools’ option to offer low-fat flavored milk with school meals, and in other nutrition programs, as proposed by the Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) in the Federal Register November 25, 2020.1 This step will help increase students’ intake of calcium, potassium, vitamin D and several other essential nutrients and may also encourage higher levels of participation in school meal programs, thereby increasing consumption of fruits and vegetables, whole grains and other healthy foods.
Importance of Dairy in Students’ Diet and Inadequacy of Current Consumption
Dairy producers take pride in supplying nutritious, great-tasting products to all Americans, especially our nation’s children and adolescents. The Dietary Guidelines for Americans (DGA), recognizing the unique nutrient package dairy foods provide, recommends all Americans choose three servings of dairy each day and specifically recommends low-fat or fat-free milk consumption. Milk supplies three of the DGA’s four nutrients of public health concern for underconsumption – calcium, potassium and vitamin D.2
Unfortunately, most Americans – including children and adolescents – fail to meet these recommendations, which means their intakes of key nutrients may be inadequate. In particular, from the age of 4 onward, all age groups of children and adolescents, both male and female, fail to consume adequate amounts of dairy. Among youth ages 9-13, 79 percent or more fall short of recommended dairy intakes, according to the 2020 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee. For all youth age 19 and younger, mean intake of dairy is only 1.9 cup-equivalent per day.3 Communities of color consume dairy at lower rates, exacerbating nutrient deficiencies which may have life-long health consequences.
4
Role of the School Meal Programs
One of the best ways to supply healthy dairy foods and model good nutritional habits is through meals and snacks in our nation’s schools and child-care centers. Therefore, we support the central role of dairy in all child nutrition programs, including those covered by the proposed rule (the National School Lunch Program [NSLP], School Breakfast Program [SBP], Special Milk Program [SMP] and Child and Adult Care Food Program [CACFP]).
Following passage of the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010 (HHFKA), implementing regulations made numerous changes in school meal patterns. Among these were provisions to limit school milk to low-fat and fat-free varieties, consistent with recommendations in the DGA. It should be noted that since that time an emerging body of science strongly suggests beneficial or neutral health effects of dairy at all fat levels.5
The 2012 final rule went further than the HHFKA in requiring that flavored milk in schools be limited to fat-free.6 This was a major change, as prior to that time, low-fat flavored milk was the most widely-consumed variety in schools.7 Unfortunately, school milk consumption declined following adoption of the new rules:
• Average daily participation in the NSLP fell significantly, which reduced milk consumption given milk is offered with each school lunch. Total NSLP meals fell from 5.2149 billion in 2012 to 4.8664 billion in 2019.8
• Periodic surveys conducted for the Milk Processor Education Program showed significant declines in milk use in schools, from 452.0 million gallons in 2011-2012 to 404.3 million in 2019-20.9
• In a survey of over 300 schools that reintroduced low-fat chocolate milk, 73 percent of the schools reported that students like this milk better.10
• FNS cited declines in milk consumption as among the primary reasons for permitting schools to again offer low-fat flavored milk.11 This flexibility was included in a final rule promulgated in 2018.12
Need for Proposed Rule
The current rulemaking is necessary because of a court decision13 that remanded the 2018 final rule to FNS for further action. In the absence of the final rule, and after expiration of meal pattern waivers now available due to the COVID-19 pandemic, regulations would revert to their 2012 requirements, and schools would be precluded from offering students low-fat flavored milk. This would have several adverse consequences:
• Most important by far, students’ milk consumption may decline, robbing them of essential nutrients they need for growth and health.
• School meal participation could decline further, as already happened in the years after the 2012 regulations were instituted.
• Schools’ procurement schedules could be called into question. In just a few short months, beginning in early spring, schools across the country will solicit bids for school milk during the 2021-22 school year. As it stands, they may be in doubt as to which varieties they are permitted to legitimately procure.
• Milk processors, including those owned by farmers, similarly will face operational uncertainties centered around whether the school market will demand low-fat or fat-free flavored milk. These uncertainties are exacerbated by the fact that retail demand for fat-free flavored milk is minuscule, so the school market is its primary outlet.
Conclusion
We strongly urge FNS to finalize regulations permitting low-fat flavored milk, at schools’ option, while requiring unflavored milk to be available as well. We would note that the proposed rule is –
• Consistent with the DGA, which recommends low-fat or fat-free milk, and therefore also consistent with the HHFKA;
• An appropriate response to the court decision in Maryland, which did not find any procedural or substantive problems with the milk provisions of the rule, provisions which were also not challenged in the underlying lawsuit;
• Consistent with overall calorie minimum and maximum levels in school meal programs, since there is only a 20-40 calorie difference
14 (and more likely closer to the lower end of that range) between low-fat and fat-free flavored milk, and 82 percent of schools in a survey said it was easy or very easy to accommodate low-fat flavored milk within the maximum calorie limits for their menus;15 and
• Consistent with the views of health professionals, including the American Heart Association which noted in a scientific statement that sweetened dairy products” such as “low-fat or fat-free flavored milk, [and] sweetened yogurt” are “foods that may have a positive impact” on diet quality.16
By giving schools more flexibility to offer low-fat flavored milk, FNS will contribute to better nutrient intakes among our nation’s youth and potentially to an increase in meal participation. We urge FNS to move expeditiously to finalize the proposed rule.

On behalf of the undersigned organizations representing more than 13,000 Local Education Agencies (LEAs), rural school districts, and K─12 education leaders, we write to submit comments in favor of the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) proposed rule entitled: Restoration of Milk, Whole Grains, and Sodium Flexibilities” (85 FR 75241). If passed, this rule would provide LEAs and other school system leaders with the necessary flexibilities to accommodate menu planning, procurement challenges, local operational differences, taste, and community preferences that currently limit student participation in the National School Lunch (NSLP) and School Breakfast Programs (SBP).
As noted in the Restoration of Milk, Whole Grains, and Sodium Flexibilities Notice of Proposed Rule Making (NPRM), the administrative and Congressional action around new provisions under the National School Lunch Act has been a contentious policy area since 2012. Specifically, many school districts found trouble complying with requirements that (1) mandated half of the grains offered in the NSLP and SBP be whole grain-rich beginning in School Year (SY) 2012-2013, (2) increased the phase II sodium restrictions for SY 2024-25, and (3) prohibited LEAs’ ability to sell and serve 1% flavored milk.
Upon acknowledgment that many school districts experienced difficulties meeting the previously mentioned requirements, USDA issued the 2018 Final Rule, which became effective July 1, 2019, for SY 2019─2020, and codified the flexibilities offered in the 2017 Interim Final Rule relating to the following:
• Allowed schools in the NSLP and SBP to offer flavored, low-fat milk (1% fat) at lunch and breakfast and as a beverage for sale à la carte, and requiring that unflavored milk (fat-free or low-fat) be available at each school meal service;
• Required that half of the weekly grains in the NSLP and SBP be whole grain-rich and that the remaining weekly grains offered be enriched; and
• Retained Sodium Target 1 through SY 2023─2024, recognizing more time was needed for Target 2 and moving it to SY 2024─2025, and removed the Final Target.
Our allied organizations supported these policy changes as they provided targeted long-term regulatory flexibility that was practical and necessary to increase student participation and decrease the food waste associated with providing unfamiliar dairy products, preparing whole grain-rich food items, and offering appealing meals with lower sodium content.
Unfortunately, the April 2020 District Court decision that vacated the 2018 Final Rule was made without consideration for the rescission’s impact on school district operations, as many schools have never truly implemented the 2012 requirements for milk, grains, or sodium as written in the 2012 NPRM. As such, our allied organizations are pleased to see that the Food Nutritional Service is maintaining its commitment to improving long-term program efficiency by continuing the flavored milk flexibility, allowing all grains offered on the school menu to meet the FNS 50% whole grain-rich criteria, and maintain Sodium Target 1 requirements through SY 2023─2024 (June 30, 2024) and remove the Final Sodium Target.
Due to the Coronavirus pandemic’s effect on normal district operations, our superintendents, school business officials, and rural districts need the maximum flexibilities and tools to ensure school food meal service operations are not further interrupted by regulatory changes in SY 2020─2021. As such, we urge you to maintain current regulatory continuity by implementing the Restoration of Milk, Whole Grains, and Sodium Flexibilities NPRM as written.

2020,FNS-2020-0038-2910,,Constituent,"Dear Ms. Namian:
Thank you for the opportunity to comment on the proposed rule, Restoration of Milk, Whole Grains, and Sodium Flexibilities, published in the Federal Register on November 25, 2020.
My name is Jennifer Bailey and I am the Section Chief for the Nutrition Services Section of the North Carolina Department of Public Instruction. The comments that follow reflect my own personal opinions and may or may not reflect the opinions of the Agency I represent. I submit my comments today as an informed citizen, a Registered Dietitian, and a dedicated School Nutrition Professional. The last twelve (12) years of my career have been devoted to School Nutrition at the local, regional, and State Agency levels. I currently have the privilege and responsibility of leading a large team of Registered Dietitians who play a vital role in ensuring the nutritional integrity of School Nutrition Programs across our state.
I fully support the standards for milk, whole grains, and sodium as written in the proposed rule. Despite many proposed rule comments stating the proposed rule is “rolling back” nutrition standards and is inconsistent with the 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans (DGA), a review of 2015-2020 DGA and the 2020 DGA Advisory Report shows evidence to the contrary. The proposed rule for milk, whole grains, and sodium is largely consistent with the Dietary Guidelines for Americans in all areas and is therefore consistent with current recommended healthy eating patterns.
Milk
The proposed rule allows School Nutrition Programs to offer flavored or unflavored fat-free or low-fat (1%) milk. This proposal is consistent with the DGA recommendations for fat content which states, “a healthy eating pattern includes fat-free or low-fat dairy.” The proposal is also consistent with recommendations for added sugars and nutrient dense foods. The DGA encourages a shift to reduce added sugar consumption to less than 10% of calories per day. Figure 2-10 on page 55 of the DGA shows that 47% of added sugars consumed are from sugar-sweetened beverages, not including milk. Only 4% of added sugars is consumed through milk and other dairy products such as yogurt. In fact, the DGA encourages fat-free or low-fat milk as an alternative option for sugar-sweetened beverages. In the DGA discussion on shifting to consume more dairy products in nutrient dense forms, it is stated that, “Some sweetened milk and yogurt products may be included in a healthy eating pattern as long as the total amount of added sugars consumed does not exceed the limit for added sugars, and the eating pattern does not exceed calorie limits.” To test the theory that flavored low-fat milk would fit these guidelines even for students with the lowest calorie recommendations, I conducted the following calculations:
❖ 1, 8-oz carton of Maola Tru Moo 1% chocolate milk (brand commonly procured in North Carolina) contains 7 grams of added sugar
❖ 2 cartons per day (breakfast and lunch) =14 grams added sugar X 4 calories/gram=56 calories per day from added sugar in milk
❖ DGA Recommended daily calorie intake for a 6-year-old sedentary female is 1200 calories per day
❖ 56 calories from added sugar/1200 calories per day x 100=4.7% of calories from added sugar from milk
❖ Based on these calculations, even at the lowest recommended daily calorie intake, two cartons of flavored 1% milk is the equivalent to 4.7% of calories from added sugar which is well below the DGA recommendation of less than 10% of calories from added sugars.
Other reasons to allow 1% flavored milk:
• According to the 2020 DGA Committee Report, “Bone mass, including peak bone mass, is influenced by dietary patterns in childhood and adolescence, and influence the time course to onset of osteoporosis.” Milk (including fat-free and low-fat flavored milk) contains critical nutrients to building peak bone mass and promoting overall health including calcium, phosphorus, vitamin A, vitamin D, riboflavin, vitamin B12, protein, potassium, zinc, choline, magnesium, and selenium.
• 1% milk contains less than 10% of total calories from saturated fat and contains 0 grams trans fat as recommended in the DGA.
• Allowance of flavoring in 1% milk increases milk palatability and promotes increased consumption by students.
A final rule allowing National School lunch Program and School Breakfast Program operators to permanently offer flavored, low-fat milk as part of a reimbursable meal and for sale as a competitive beverage is consistent with the Dietary Guidelines for Americans and a critical step toward increasing milk consumption to promote healthy students.
Whole Grains
The proposed rule allows for half of the weekly grains in the National School Lunch Program and School Breakfast Program menus to be whole grain-rich. This proposal is largely consistent with the DGA recommendations for whole grains which states, “A healthy eating pattern includes: Grains, at least half of which are whole grains.” The DGA discusses various ways to achieve consuming half of grains as whole grains including eating half of grains as 100% whole grains, eating 100% of whole grain products containing at least 50% or more whole grains (whole grain-rich), or eating a mixture of 100% whole grains and whole grain-rich products to equal half of grains as whole over a week. The technicality of wording between the proposed rule and the DGA could lend itself to some inconsistency between the two guidelines and is likely the reason for the 100% whole grain-rich requirements set forth in the 2012 final rule. Taken in the extreme circumstance, if the menu planner offered half of the grains as whole grain-rich products containing only the minimum amount (50%) of whole grains, then students would be offered less than half of grains as whole grains over a week. In the extreme circumstance, this would be inconsistent with the DGA. However, in my experience as a dietitian, district level menu planner, and state level reviewer in school nutrition, I have never seen a menu planned with only whole grain-rich products that meet minimum standards. Menus are typically planned with a mixture of 100% whole grain items and whole grain-rich products containing 50% or more whole grains. It is much more likely that menus meet or are very close to meeting the recommendations of the DGA under the flexibilities of the proposed rule. According to the SNA 2019 Trends report, 90% of the responding districts were planning to exceed whole grain requirements and more than
70% of reported that they planned to offer 75% or more grains as whole grain-rich. This provides further evidence that schools will meet the DGA recommendation under the flexibility of the proposed rule.
To minimize confusion, perhaps the final rule should include the wording from the DGA instead of the whole grain-rich terminology and provide the options discussed in the guidelines for ways to achieve consuming half of grains as whole grains.
Other whole grain considerations:
• Whole grains provide essential nutrients and fiber, and regular consumption has been shown to be protective against cardiovascular disease, overweight and obesity, Type II Diabetes, and a variety of cancers.
• Most students are not accustomed to eating 100% whole grain products at home. By offering students half of all grains as whole-grain rich, they are introduced to more nutritional options while being offered familiar foods as well.
• As stated in the 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans, “Most refined grains are enriched, a process that adds back iron and four B vitamins (thiamin, riboflavin, niacin, and folic acid).” Therefore, refined grain products also provide key nutrients vital to our student’s health.
• 100% of North Carolina School Food Authorities requested and were granted a whole grain waiver. This demonstrates the critical need for whole grain flexibility in North Carolina
• According to the SNA School Nutrition Trends 2019 Report the following barriers are reported with serving 100% whole grain-rich products: Student acceptance (71.9%), product availability (22 %).
• While availability of palatable whole grain options has improved, acceptance of a 100% whole grain-rich items would be difficult. Generally accepted items include whole wheat bread, oatmeal, brown rice, pizza crust, and cereal. Other whole grain options such as certain pastas, breading for meat entrees, breakfast quick breads, grits, biscuits, tortillas, crackers, etc., are generally less accepted by students.
• Cultural relevance is important to keep in mind. Some grain products are not historically whole grain. For example, biscuits, tortilla wraps and grits. Manufacturers have made many attempts to produce an acceptable whole grain biscuit to no avail; the products were not of acceptable quality to students and breakfast participation on days biscuits were offered was reduced dramatically. Whole grain tortillas are most often enriched and not whole grain. Sandwich wraps, burritos or fajitas made with enriched instead of whole grain flour could be more popular among students, thereby increasing participation and still providing adequate nutrition. A whole grain option could be paired with an enriched option to provide a balance of whole grains in the meal, such as pairing brown rice or tortilla chips with entrees made using enriched flour wraps or tortillas.
Whole grains are an essential addition to a healthy diet to protect against a variety of diseases and health conditions. To derive these benefits, it is only necessarily to consume half of all grains as whole over a week. The requirement for all grains to be whole grain-rich discourages consumption due to palatability concerns for many items. Not all grains are intended to be consumed as whole-grain rich. While the 2012 final rule had good intentions of increasing beneficial whole grain consumption, there have been unintended consequences. In addition to switching to whole grain versions of whole foods such as switching from white rice to brown rice, there has also been an introduction of more whole grain-rich products which often contain added sugars, fat, and sodium to increase palatability. When all grains are required to be whole grain-rich, these potentially less healthy products become a necessity to meet regulatory requirements.
I support the proposed rule for half of grains offered as whole-grain rich throughout the week with more emphasis on whole grain foods and less emphasis on whole grain-rich products.
Sodium
The proposed rule provides schools participating in the National School Lunch Program and School Breakfast Program more time for gradual sodium reduction by retaining Sodium Target 1 through the end of school year (SY) 2023-2024, continuing to Target 2 in SY 2024-2025, and eliminating the Final Target. This proposal considers the DGA promoted incremental shifts towards lower consumption of sodium. The DGA states, “A healthy eating pattern limits: Saturated fats and trans fats, added sugars, and sodium. Consume less than 2,300 milligrams (mg) per day of sodium.”
In response to the 2012 Final Rule, and in an effort to assist School Nutrition Programs with the incremental decreases in sodium and changes to other areas of the meal pattern, the North Carolina State Agency partnered with Chef Cyndie Story and her team to co-create and implement the North Carolina K-12 Culinary Institute. The intent of the Institute was to assist School Nutrition Programs to provide tasty meals to students that also promote compliance the new regulations. The Institute provided a multitude of student tested recipes (low sodium, whole-grain, etc.), culinary skills, merchandizing skills, customer service skills, and the menu planning knowledge necessary for each School Nutrition Administrator and School Nutrition Manager who attended the two or three day institute to be successful with meeting the 2012 standards. Attendees were taught how, and required to, teach forward knowledge and skills acquired during the institute.
Despite efforts of the North Carolina K-12 Culinary Institute to introduce low-sodium recipes with herbs and spices intended to appeal to students, and despite USDA food manufacturers and commercial manufacturers efforts reformulate products and introduce lower sodium/no sodium options, efforts to reach sodium Target 2 have had detrimental consequences on meal participation. Particularly impacted has been vegetable consumption. Frankly, herbs and spices can only go so far to season beans, greens, and other vegetables without a little salt to enhance flavor. Decreases in vegetable consumption are alarming due to the multitude of nutrients they provide that are protective of health. When examining decreased vegetable consumption due to decreases in sodium, one needs to weigh the risk of also decreasing potassium consumption. Vegetables are an excellent source of potassium. Potassium is protective against high blood pressure and related co-morbidities that proponents of strict sodium targets are aiming impact. When consumed in appropriate amounts potassium can help counteract impacts of high sodium intake. This is just one example of an unintended consequence of decrease vegetable consumption due to decreases in sodium in recipes and products. FNS says it best on page 75245 of the proposed rule, “FNS must ensure continued participation in the program during this process—if children will not eat the healthy food served in schools, children are not benefiting from the nutrition standards enacted. Students need to eat the food to acquire the nutrition, meaning we need to increase participation and decrease food waste.”
Competition with school meals is fierce. From meals packed at home, to open campuses, to meal delivery services, the options for meals offered to today’s student are endless and School Nutrition Programs must be able to compete. If our food does not taste good, students will look elsewhere. Without sweeping changes to the entire food system, from manufacturers to restaurants to the home, and a nationwide incremental adjustment of salt preferences, it will be nearly impossible for School Nutrition Programs to reach Target 2 while maintaining robust participation in school meals.
Regarding elimination of the Final Target, the District Court found that it was within USDA's discretion to wait until after the new Dietary Guidelines and DRIs were released to set any final targets for sodium content. The District
Court found that the USDA adequately explained and acknowledged its shift in policy from the 2012 Final Rule to the 2018 Final Rule (Proposed Rule pg. 75244).” I agree with waiting for this release.
Thank you for taking the time to consider the information provided in this letter. Healthy eating is not complicated; however, providing healthy meals to children has become extremely complicated. I want to thank USDA for your constant support and persistent efforts to provide flexibilities that are consistent with the Dietary Guidelines for Americans and allow schools to provide healthy meals students will enjoy. The 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans began moving us back toward less complicated healthy eating patterns. I am looking forward to the adoption of 2020-2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans that, based on the 2020 Dietary Guidelines Committee Report, appear to be moving even further in the direction of overall healthy meal patterns and less of a focus on individual nutrients. The proposed rules discussed above are rooted in the sound advice of the Dietary Guidelines, so I leave you with this quote from the Dietary Guidelines. “When it comes to improving food and beverage choices, small changes can add up to big benefits. That’s why the Dietary Guidelines emphasizes shifts—doable, healthy changes to how people already eat.” The proposed rule flexibilities are small changes that will add up to big benefits.

Our members provide many of the foods that are served under the School Meals Programs.<br/>AFFI&rsquo;s members share FNS&rsquo;s commitment to ensuring students receive safe and nutritious foods through the School Meals Programs. We agree with FNS that schools are best equipped to develop meal plans that will provide wholesome, nutritious foods that reflect local food availability and student preferences. AFFI supports FNS&rsquo;s proposals to provide schools with greater flexibility and control over food service decisions and to assist schools in reducing reduce food waste, while maintaining the nutritional integrity of foods served through the School Meals Programs.<br/>AFFI supports FNS maintaining the flexibility in USDA child nutrition program meal requirements related to milk, grains, and sodium, by:  <br/>&bull;<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Allowing flavored, low-fat milk in the Child Nutrition Programs; <br/>&bull;<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Allowing half of the weekly grains offered through the school meal programs to be whole grain-rich; and <br/>&bull;<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Providing schools more time for gradual sodium reduction by retaining Sodium Target 1 through the end of SY 2023-2024, continuing to Target 2 in SY 2024-2025, and eliminating the Final Target. <br/><br/>In maintaining these flexibilities, FNS responded to persistent challenges with the milk, grains, and sodium requirements that were identified by schools included decreased student participation, decreased meal consumption, difficulties preparing whole grain-rich food items, and limited ability to offer appealing meals with lower sodium content.<br/><br/>Sodium Reduction<br/>In previous comments, AFFI shared with FNS that product development and testing take considerable time and can take two to five years to reformulate and develop food products that support new requirements. The process involves innovation, research and development, testing, commercialization, launch, and marketing. Food manufacturers face challenges with replacing sodium in some foods given its functionality in adding flavor and preserving food. <br/><br/>Providing additional flexibility for sodium reduction would allow the operational flexibility and time necessary for manufacturers, producers, and vendors to develop and produce compliant products. This rule recognizes the persistent menu planning challenges experienced by schools, which have become more difficult during the ongoing global pandemic, seeks to balance nutrition science, practical application of requirements, and the need to ensure that children receive school meals they will eat.<br/> <br/>*<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>*<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>*<br/><br/>In sum, AFFI agrees with proponents, like the School Nutrition Association, that suggested that these flexibilities would provide more menu planning options for schools, and thus enhance their ability to offer wholesome and appealing meals. We believe that the flexibilities will lead to increased participation and meal consumption and provide a permanent solution to operational challenges versus relying on temporary rules and annual waivers. This targeted regulatory flexibility provides a practical and necessary approach for efficient Program operation and should improve student participation by enabling schools to offer children more appealing meals that would still be consistent with the goals of the Dietary Guidelines for Americans. In addition, AFFI supports FNS&rsquo; recognition that allowing for taste preferences and operational flexibility are essential to incentivizing the food industry&#39;s efforts to support the development of nutritious and delicious school meals.<br/><br/>If we can answer any questions related to these comments or provide any assistance as FNS implements this rule, please let us know.<br/>",In favor of flexibilies
2020,FNS-2020-0038-2914,,Constituent,"Milk flexibilities  <br/>Im agreeable to the continuation to allow offering a skim/fat free and 1% milk (both as a flavored variety) in addition to offering an unflavored milk variety of skim/fat free and/or 1% in the NSLP/SBP (students seem to enjoy having flavored milk to choose from and based on observation during on-site school reviews and participation reports, students selected flavored milk more often over unflavored milk).<br/>Also by continuing to offer a flavored milk (1% and/or skim/fat free) this allows students a milk choice that would complement their meals with a milk (nutrient based beverage) and will also compliment the meal(s) with added nutrients such as protein, calcium, vitamins A, D, etc.<br/><br/>Whole Grains  <br/>Based on feedback and observation during on-site school reviews, students preferred whole grain products that were lighter in color for select menu items such as hamburger buns, hotdogs buns, biscuits, and rolls.  Also, it was noted based on feedback from School Nutrition Administrators that participation was lower overall from students to select whole grains that that were not familiar with and not receiving at home such as whole grain hamburger buns, whole grain hot dog buns, biscuits, and rolls where palatability was more of a challenge.  I am in favor of the continuation of allowing half of the weekly grains to be whole grain rich to allow this flexibility with the menu to assist the School Nutrition Administrators with the challenges that have faced with increasing and/or maintaining student participation in the National School Lunch Program (NSLP)/School Breakfast Program (SBP). <br/><br/>Sodium  <br/>In reviewing nutrient profiles of several menu items and evaluating nutrient analysis, a further reduction in sodium may be difficult to maintain the palatability of the menu that is generally served to school-age students.  Over the past few years, schools in NC have worked very hard to change and adapt menus that include a variety of foods that include a variety of fresh fruits, fresh and frozen vegetables that are naturally low in sodium and have worked to balance out their school menus to keep the current sodium targets closely in line to the dietary specifications.<br/>For taste palatability, a further reduction in sodium levels may be difficult to maintain palatability with select menu items especially with entre type items.  Since sodium is a naturally occurring mineral in several foods (especially processed food) and also in milk, a further reduction may involve having a therapeutic threshold which may be unrealistic to serve to school-aged children in the NSLP/SBP.<br/><br/>",In favor of flexibilies
